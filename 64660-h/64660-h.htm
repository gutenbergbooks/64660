<h2 class="nobreak">CHAPTER I</h2>



<p class="drop-cap">COLONEL FENCHURCH stood on his own
hearthstone&mdash;that is to say, the smoking-room
rug&mdash;with his back to the fire, and a cup of tea in his
hand. He was a good-looking dapper little man, with
a neat white moustache, a cheery voice, and an unfailing
flow of talk.</p>

<p>&#8220;I say, Doodie,&#8221; turning to a lady in a splashed
habit, who was meditatively consuming buttered
toast, &#8220;weren&#8217;t the roads beastly? Just look at my
boots and leathers!&#8221;</p>

<p>Doodie, his wife, nodded, but made no other
reply.</p>

<p>&#8220;A clinking run,&#8221; he continued, &#8220;and a lot of those
thrusters got left&mdash;you went well&mdash;eh?&mdash;that was a
nasty place out of the round plantation!&mdash;on the
whole&mdash;a good hard day!&#8221;</p>

<p>Once more his better-half inclined her hatted head;
evidently her mind was preoccupied. She was staring
fixedly at a certain pattern in the carpet, with a remote
and far-away gaze; a plain weather-beaten lady whose
age&mdash;much discussed among her acquaintances&mdash;was<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_2"></a>[2]</span>
probably five-and-forty; her habit displayed a slight
square-shouldered figure; a pot hat pushed to the
back of her head disclosed the inevitable red mark,
a long but aristocratic nose, and a clever resolute
countenance.</p>

<p>Dorothy Fenchurch was a notable example of the
strong-willed active woman, mated to a weak, easy-going,
good-tempered man: and the match had proved
a conspicuous success. In the opinion of Tom Fenchurch,
no wife in the County was fit to hold a candle
to his wonderful Dorothy&mdash;what a housekeeper, horsewoman,
companion!&mdash;and for her part, his Dorothy
was contented. Greedy of influence, social and
domestic, she thoroughly enjoyed the <i>r&ocirc;le</i> of manager
and mentor. How much more satisfactory to rule in
a small establishment, and over a limited circle, than
to languish at home, the insignificant member of an
important house, who kept their women-folk inflexibly
in the background; and so it came to pass that twelve
years previously, the Honourable Dorothy Claremont
bestowed her hand and her fortune on agreeable
Colonel Fenchurch, who had little to offer her, besides
his handsome face, his retired pay, and his heart.</p>

<p>The couple had settled down in a ramshackle old
house, in a ramshackle old village in the Midlands,
inconveniently remote from the railway, but within
easy reach of the principal Meets of a well-known
sporting pack. The bride&#8217;s relations&mdash;who had not
favoured the alliance&mdash;shrugged their shoulders and
commiserated &#8216;poor Dorothy.&#8217; They little knew that<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_3"></a>[3]</span>
&#8216;poor Dorothy,&#8217; now thoroughly free and independent,
was as happy as the day was long!</p>

<p>Here, in the sleepy hamlet of Thornby, the Honble.
Mrs. Fenchurch soon made her presence felt. She, so
to speak, &#8216;took hold&#8217; with both hands; stirred up the
villagers, the parson, and the doctor; improved the old
manor out of all recognition&mdash;and that at no great
expense.</p>

<p>This energetic lady had the good fortune to discover
a priceless treasure in the village carpenter, and he and
a journeyman mason, a few odd men, with Mrs. Fenchurch
as architect, threw out a window here, shut up
a door there, and boldly altered the principal staircase.
By and by when visitors arrived to call, and were
beholders of these amazing triumphs, more than
one exclaimed:</p>

<p>&#8220;Why on earth did <i>we</i> not think of taking The Holt,
and doing it up? It is perfectly delightful&mdash;who
would have guessed at its capabilities?&#8221;</p>

<p>But these envious folk never considered that its
present tenant was endowed with an unusual supply
of brains, enterprise, and courage. She was a born
decorator, a skilled upholsteress, and had a positive
genius for gardening. Before long, the attractions of
The Holt were famous within a radius of ten miles&mdash;Mrs.
Fenchurch seemed to know exactly where to find
the prettiest chintzes, the most unique furniture, the
newest roses; and her cleverness in picking up prizes in
old curiosity shops had become a proverb. It was
said, that in a back street of the county town she had<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_4"></a>[4]</span>
actually bought a wonderful old Chippendale sideboard
for fifteen shillings&mdash;but this would appear to be
incredible.</p>

<p>For twelve years The Holt was acknowledged to be
one of the pleasantest houses in the County, its inmates
the most popular, important, and influential
couple of the neighbourhood, and here Doodie Fenchurch
(with good-natured Tom as her consort) reigned
alone and supreme.</p>

<p>But now a change was imminent; a princess was
about to enter into this kingdom&mdash;yes, and to enter
within half an hour. Possibly this was why its mistress
seemed so unusually silent and <i>distrait</i>.</p>

<p>The only sister of Colonel Fenchurch had made a
runaway match with a harum-scarum Irishman, who
was killed in India, leaving his widow almost penniless.
She died soon afterwards, and the unnecessary infant
who ought to have accompanied her mother, survived
to be supported by the Fenchurch family&mdash;themselves
uncomfortably impecunious. Now this girl was seventeen,
and in spite of Mrs. Fenchurch&#8217;s lamentations,
protestations, and suggestion that she should remain
another year, Letty Glyn had left school, and was on
her way to take up her abode with darling Uncle Tom,
and dearest Aunt Dorothy.</p>

<p>Apparently dearest Aunt Dorothy was not warmly
enthusiastic respecting her niece by marriage; but she
was a woman who sedulously studied appearances.
If Tom&#8217;s niece were turned out to earn her bread as
companion or governess, what a talk there would be!<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_5"></a>[5]</span>
There was positively no alternative, the girl must
make her home at The Holt, in the character of <i>le
f&acirc;cheux troisi&egrave;me</i>.</p>

<p>As a child, Letty had promised to be rather pretty,
and Mrs. Fenchurch believed that with her own social
advantages, she would marry her off ere long; but
before arriving at this happy period, she resolved to
make the poor relation useful in the house. She should
dust china, arrange flowers, pour out tea, help in the
garden, and take over the Mothers&#8217; Sewing Club. Her
own hands were more than full both at home and
abroad (indeed, the influence of Mrs. Fenchurch now
radiated far and wide), she was secretary here, treasurer
and chairwoman there, and was often sorely
pressed for time. Oh yes, Letty would have her uses;
but all the same a girl in the house&mdash;a girl, who was
always <i>en evidence</i>, to whom one must be a sort of
model and sheep dog, would undoubtedly be an
intolerable nuisance.</p>

<p>&#8220;I say,&#8221; began her husband, breaking in upon her
reflections. She looked up at him quickly. &#8220;Isn&#8217;t
Letty due about now? Six-thirty?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Oh yes, if the train is pretty punctual; but you
know what these cross lines are.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Do you think she will be a little hurt at no one
going to meet her&mdash;eh?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Hurt! My dear boy, what nonsense!&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Well, of course, hunting is hunting, and Garfield
Cross is our best meet. By the way, I suppose you sent
the brougham? It&#8217;s an uncommonly cold, raw night.&#8221;</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_6"></a>[6]</span>&#8220;The brougham? Certainly not! I sent the
governess-car&mdash;yes,&#8221; in answer to his exclamation.
&#8220;You see, dear, Collins has had three horses to do up&mdash;you
know you had out two&mdash;you extravagant man,
and I really couldn&#8217;t ask him to leave them all to
James, so the boy took the car with the garden pony,
and her luggage will come up to-morrow by the
market-cart.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I say, old girl,&#8221; suddenly putting down his cup
and going over to her, &#8220;it&#8217;s not a very warm reception,
eh? The child has not been near us this five years&mdash;and
it&#8217;s a long journey from Dresden, eh?&#8221; Then, in
another and more caressing tone, he added, &#8220;You <i>will</i>
be good to her, Doodie darling, won&#8217;t you? You can
make it so awfully nice, if you like to, you know!&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Am I not always what you call &#8216;good&#8217; to my
guests?&#8221; she demanded rather sharply.</p>

<p>&#8220;Oh, hang it all, Doodie, but <i>she</i> won&#8217;t be a guest!
Letty is one of us, eh&mdash;isn&#8217;t she, old woman? Of
course, I know it&#8217;s hard on you, and she has only her
little bit of a pension; but a girl in the house will be
cheery, eh? And you&#8217;ll take to her, I know,&#8221; and he
put his arm round her neck, and gazed into her shrewd,
thin face, and repeated, &#8220;Eh, darling, won&#8217;t you?&#8221;</p>

<p>Just at this moment the door opened, and a formal
voice announced &#8216;Mrs. Hesketh.&#8217;</p>

<p>Mrs. Hesketh, a middle-aged lady with a stately
carriage and the remains of great beauty, entered just
in time to witness the caressing attitude of Colonel
Fenchurch.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_7"></a>[7]</span>&#8220;We have had a row, you see!&#8221; he explained to
the visitor with the gaiety of a schoolboy; &#8220;the old
woman and I have had a shake-up, and been making it
up&mdash;she <i>will</i> pound me out hunting. I call it deuced
bad form, eh?&#8221;</p>

<p>Mrs. Hesketh, a widowed cousin who lived in the
only other &#8216;house&#8217; in the village, carefully removed
her heavy sables before she replied.</p>

<p>&#8220;I should think, Tom, that you are used to that by
this time. Had you had a good day?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Ripping!&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Many out?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Oh, the usual lot, and Hugo Blagdon. By Jove!
he does have wonderful cattle. I hear he pays as much
as five hundred for a hunter. Yes, and he can ride
them too,&#8221; he added with unusual generosity.</p>

<p>&#8220;But what brings him over to this side?&#8221; enquired
Mrs. Hesketh with languid curiosity.</p>

<p>&#8220;He&#8217;s only staying at the &#8216;Black Cock&#8217; at Ridgefield
for a week or so&mdash;it&#8217;s more central than Sharsley.
Sharsley is a good bit out of the way for everything;
seven miles from a railway station&mdash;monstrous, isn&#8217;t
it in these days?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Yes, but we need not boast. Sharsley is a lovely
old place; I shouldn&#8217;t mind living there myself!&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;No,&#8221; he answered with a laugh; &#8220;and a heap of
other ladies will say ditto to Mrs. Hesketh, eh, Doodie?&#8221;
appealing to his wife.</p>

<p>&#8220;I can&#8217;t think what&#8217;s keeping her,&#8221; was the irrelevant
reply.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_8"></a>[8]</span>Mrs. Hesketh stared at her cousin with grave-eyed
interrogation.</p>

<p>&#8220;Oh, I mean Letty Glyn, Tom&#8217;s niece, you know,
Maudie. Didn&#8217;t I tell you that we expect her this
evening, by the two o&#8217;clock from St. Pancras?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;So you did; and she is coming to stay for some time?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;To live with us altogether,&#8221; eagerly amended
Colonel Fenchurch. &#8220;She is an orphan, the daughter
of my poor sister Kathleen.&#8221;</p>

<p>Mrs. Hesketh glanced from him to his wife, but Mrs.
Fenchurch&#8217;s expression was blank and noncommittal;
she rose, walked to the fire, and brushed the crumbs
from her habit into the fender.</p>

<p>&#8220;We are her only relations,&#8221; continued Colonel Fenchurch.</p>

<p>&#8220;Except her father&#8217;s people, who are paupers,&#8221;
corrected a thin, high-pitched treble from the fire-place.
&#8220;Irish paupers&mdash;with nothing to live on but family
pride.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;If she is like my poor sister, she ought to be a
beauty,&#8221; urged her uncle, and his tone was anxious
and conciliatory.</p>

<p>&#8220;She was some way from <i>that</i> when we last saw
her,&#8221; declared his wife, turning to face them; &#8220;a
long-legged creature, with a pair of sunken eyes and
quantities of tousled hair. Of course, she may have
improved,&#8221; she added tolerantly; &#8220;and,&#8221; with a
glance at her husband&#8217;s chiselled profile, &#8220;I hope she
will take after the Fenchurch family. A girl with a
pretty face does get such a splendid start.&#8221;</p>



<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_9"></a>[9]</span>&#8220;She does,&#8221; agreed Mrs. Hesketh, whose own beautiful
face had been her fortune; &#8220;but if she hasn&#8217;t
something to back it up in the way of character, or
brains, or charm,&mdash;it&#8217;s not so much of a start, after all.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Hullo&mdash;wheels!&#8221; announced Colonel Fenchurch.
&#8220;Here she is!&#8221; and he dashed into the hall.</p>

<p>&#8220;I think I ought to go,&#8221; murmured the visitor,
reaching for her boa; &#8220;this is a family affair,&#8221; she
added with a smile.</p>

<p>&#8220;And you are one of the family, Maudie,&#8221; declared
Mrs. Fenchurch, laying a strong detaining hand upon
her arm; &#8220;so you must stay.&#8221; Then, removing her
hat, which she tossed on the sofa, she was about to
follow her husband, when the door was thrown wide,
and Colonel Fenchurch advanced into the room, beaming
with pride, and leading a tall girl in a fur-lined
cloak, who looked both timid and tired.</p>

<p>&#8220;My dear Letty, how late you are!&#8221; exclaimed her
aunt, taking both her hands in hers and pecking her
on the cheek; &#8220;and how frozen!&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;There was a slight accident which delayed us,&#8221;
explained the girl nervously.</p>

<p>&#8220;Now, then, give me your cloak, and have some
tea, and tell us all about it,&#8221; said her uncle, fussing
round her.</p>

<p>&#8220;I am afraid the tea is rather cold,&#8221; said Mrs. Fenchurch,
moving towards the tea equipage; &#8220;but we
will have some more at once,&#8221; and she rang the bell
violently.</p>

<p>&#8220;Maudie, this is my niece Lettice,&#8221; said Colonel<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_10"></a>[10]</span>
Fenchurch, presenting her with ceremony. &#8220;Letty,
Mrs. Hesketh is our nearest neighbour and your
aunt&#8217;s cousin, and I hope you may find a corner in
her heart.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;My dear, you must be perished,&#8221; said the lady
kindly. &#8220;Why, I declare you are positively shivering!&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Oh no, no,&#8221; she protested, whilst her uncle helped
her to remove her wrap. &#8220;This room is delightfully
warm.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Now, Letty, take off your hat,&#8221; he urged eagerly.</p>

<p>&#8220;I am afraid my hair is dreadfully untidy,&#8221; but she
nevertheless removed a fur cap, and bared a head of
beautiful light brown hair, which exhibited a natural
wave.</p>

<p>&#8220;So you have had a long journey,&#8221; continued Mrs.
Hesketh.</p>

<p>&#8220;Yes, nearly two days&mdash;we all travelled together&mdash;I
mean the girls at my school&mdash;as far as London.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;And the crossing?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Oh,&#8221; with a quick, expressive gesture, &#8220;<i>dreadful</i>!
I&#8217;d rather not think of it! Sometimes the boat stood
upright!&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Come tell us about your railway accident,&#8221; said
her uncle cheerfully.</p>

<p>&#8220;It was really nothing,&#8221; she answered; &#8220;we ran
past another train that had been shunted, and the end
of it caught our carriage doors, or something&mdash;at any
rate we were nearly shaken off the line. It gave us a
shock, for we were travelling fast, and were dreadfully
mixed up in our compartment.&#8221;</p>



<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_11"></a>[11]</span>&#8220;And who were you mixed up with?&#8221; he enquired
jocosely.</p>

<p>&#8220;The young man in the opposite seat,&#8221; and she
coloured and laughed. &#8220;He wore an enormously
thick ulster, and so I wasn&#8217;t a bit hurt.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;And afterwards?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;We had all to get out and wait at a tiny station
for more than an hour&mdash;such a bare miserable&mdash;&mdash;&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Do you take sugar?&#8221; interrupted Mrs. Fenchurch,
with the tongs in her hand.</p>

<p>&#8220;Yes, if you please, aunt&mdash;one lump.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Then here is your tea at last, and some nice hot
toast,&#8221; said Colonel Fenchurch, approaching. As he
sat down beside her he said, &#8220;And how did you and
the young man continue the acquaintance so violently
begun?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;He asked me if I was hurt&mdash;that was all.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;The least he could do! Why, bless my soul, he
might have knocked all your front teeth down your
throat, or put out one of your eyes&mdash;and then he would
have had to marry you, eh?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I am sure he wouldn&#8217;t have agreed to that,&#8221; she
answered gaily.</p>

<p>&#8220;He might go further, and fare worse,&#8221; rejoined her
uncle, with a proud and significant glance at his wife,
who had now approached the sofa.</p>

<p>&#8220;Of course, you left your luggage at Tatton, Letty?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Yes, Aunt Dorothy; I only brought up my dressing-bag.
The boy gave me your message.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;That was right. And now, as soon as you feel a<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_12"></a>[12]</span>
little rested, I will take you upstairs. Your quarters
are at the top of the house, but large and sunny&mdash;with
a funny little staircase all to yourself!&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I am sure it is charming, aunt,&#8221; rising as she spoke;
&#8220;it will be delightful to have not only a staircase, but a
whole room to myself,&#8221; and with a pretty little foreign
curtsey to Mrs. Hesketh, the girl collected her wraps
and followed Mrs. Fenchurch into the hall.</p>

<p>&#8220;Well, what do you think of her, eh?&#8221; enquired
Colonel Fenchurch, retiring to the hearth-rug as to a
vantage ground, and sticking his thumbs into the arm-holes
of his waistcoat.</p>

<p>&#8220;She is <i>lovely</i>,&#8221; replied his companion, after a
moment&#8217;s deliberation. &#8220;When one sees a girl so
fresh, so exquisite, and so unconscious, one cannot
help thinking of the quotation, &#8216;What of the lovers in
the hidden years?&#8217;&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Lovers be hanged!&#8221; he exclaimed irritably.
&#8220;Letty is too young yet&mdash;we shall keep her with
us as long as we can. She seems as simple as a child,
doesn&#8217;t she?&mdash;and rather shy?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I fancy she is one of those girls who develop slowly.
Her age may be seventeen, but in experience of life
probably she is not more than ten or twelve.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Lots of girls know their way about the world at
seventeen, and are one too many for many a man,&#8221; declared
Colonel Fenchurch; &#8220;but I remember that my
sister, ten years my junior, was extraordinarily young
in her ideas, easily influenced, ready to be ordered
about, and as obedient as if she were a kid. She never<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_13"></a>[13]</span>
knew her own mind&mdash;or had any fixed opinions&mdash;except
about Glyn. He made up her mind, and ordered
her to run away with him, a handsome, reckless, dare-devil.
They went out to India to his regiment, and he
was killed within a year up on the frontier, some fool-hardy
exploit, or he would be alive now.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;And take his daughter off your hands,&#8221; suggested
the lady.</p>

<p>&#8220;Oh, well, I am happy and proud to adopt
his daughter&mdash;especially since I have none of my
own.&#8221;</p>

<p>He paused, and stared down into the fire; his companion
well knew that this was the one grief of his
married life. Tom loved children, and was ever the
most popular and entertaining guest at their dances
and amusements; he longed to hear the patter of
quick little feet up and down The Holt&#8217;s uneven
passages. Doodie, his wife, had never shared this
craving&mdash;the whole County was, so to speak, <i>her</i>
child. Possibly she would not have objected to a fine
clever boy, who excelled at games and was a brilliant
success as a prize-winner, but a large family of daughters&mdash;no,
thank you! Her husband, on the contrary,
had a particular partiality for girls. Often, as he smoked
a solitary pipe in the fire-light, with half-closed eyes,
he seemed to see a golden-haired darling, the daughter
of his dreams, sitting on the hearth-rug, or standing by
the window. And here to-day, had actually come to
him, the realisation of his visions!</p>

<p>&#8220;I do hope&mdash;I do hope&mdash;&mdash;&#8221; he began, then hesitated.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_14"></a>[14]</span>Mrs. Hesketh raised her dark discontented eyes to
his, and murmured an interrogative &#8220;Yes?&#8221;</p>

<p>After a momentary struggle between inclination
and discretion, he continued, &#8220;Between you and me,
Maudie,&#8221; lowering his voice to a whisper, &#8220;I hope to
goodness that Doodie will take to her!&#8221;</p>

<h2 class="nobreak">CHAPTER II</h2>
</div>


<p class="drop-cap">IT must be admitted that November is not an auspicious
month for a stranger to make acquaintance
with the English country; the trees are bare and
leafless, the fields empty and uninteresting, and what
can be said for monotonous, muddy roads, cold frosty
mornings, and long dark nights?</p>

<p>However, Letty speedily settled into her awarded
niche, and endeavoured to make herself at home. She
soon became acquainted with the dogs and horses,
with her uncle&#8217;s little fads, and her aunt&#8217;s peculiarities,
duly appeared at church, was presented to the
parson&#8217;s afflicted wife, and made a state call upon Mrs.
Hesketh. Also, she did her utmost to be useful; but
her well-meaning efforts were not always successful.
For instance, with respect to arranging flowers, the
schoolgirl had no experience, her vases looked ragged,
or in clumps; she lacked the &#8216;airy, fairy&#8217; touch of
an expert&mdash;but that, no doubt, would come. Then as
to dusting the valuable old china; here again she was
something of a failure. In handling a cherished blue
plate, it slipped through her fingers as a thing alive,
rolled defiantly along a stone passage, and subsided in
a dozen pieces. Although Mrs. Fenchurch had picked
this up for sevenpence in a village inn, it was a good<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_16"></a>[16]</span>
specimen, and she showed her displeasure and annoyance
plainly&mdash;in fact so plainly, that Letty wept!
However, day by day the new-comer improved; she
helped her aunt to feed the fowls, and date and pack
the eggs for sale, assisted in the greenhouse, brushed
and exercised the dogs, and took an humble and subordinate
part in Mrs. Fenchurch&#8217;s numerous and absorbing
occupations.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>The Holt was situated at the extremity of a picturesque
village, which consisted of a rambling street of
red brick or black and white houses; half-way down
this, perched on a high bank, was a fine old church,
with its surrounding graveyard; and here and there,
were little shops, and quaint signboards, and what had
once been a celebrated posting inn&mdash;now used for the
storage of grain. At the further end of Thornby was a
grim-faced Georgian mansion, standing back from the
road, its lawn and approach well screened from view
by thick laurel hedges; immediately behind the residence,
were large and unexpectedly delightful grounds.
Mrs. Hesketh, who had occupied Oldcourt for ten
years, was a childless widow, with few belongings or
intimates; once a notable leader in society, but
latterly indifferent health, and serious money losses,
had swept her out of the social current, and she had
come to Thornby to live near her active cousin, Dolly
Fenchurch, possibly in hopes of catching the contagion
of her love for a busy rural life. An intellectual woman,<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_17"></a>[17]</span>
and an omnivorous reader, Maude Hesketh dwelt to a
great extent within herself; eagerly watching, through
the columns of the Press, the great world as it went
rolling by.</p>

<p>Once a year she emerged from her retirement, and
went to take the waters at Aix; but the remainder
of the time she occupied herself with her books,
her flowers, and her own thoughts. In spite of her
solitude, Mrs. Hesketh was beautifully dressed, she
dressed to please and satisfy a dainty, fastidious taste.
Her house, too, was refined, and filled with old French
furniture, clever impressionist sketches, <i>bibelots</i>, and
exquisitely bound books; and although she had lost a
considerable part of her income in a notorious financial
failure, she was comfortably off, and kept a carriage,
which she rarely used. The lady had the reputation
of being eccentric, and something of a mystery;
chiefly because she held herself studiously aloof from
her neighbours, and was said to give herself ridiculous
airs! This was a mistake. Mrs. Hesketh did not
cultivate local society, simply because it bored her.
She was not interested in parish squabbles, county
scandals, or domestic servants; but she visited in the
village, where she was much beloved by the poor.</p>

<p>To sum her up, Maude Hesketh was a clever, noble-hearted,
dissatisfied woman, bitterly disappointed
to find that with all her gifts and opportunities, she
had made so little of her life. And now, as she would
say to herself, &#8220;There is no time&mdash;it is almost over!&#8221;</p>

<p>But to return to The Holt after this digression. The<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_18"></a>[18]</span>
new inmate was beginning to make her presence felt
in the household, she was a ready learner, being both
keen and adaptable; her aunt&#8217;s example and capabilities
impressed her enormously; every day, every
hour seemed to have its own particular task. Mrs.
Fenchurch had a wonderful sense of organisation and
routine, and never one moment to spare. Her writing-room
was the nucleus of her activities; here on a
neat bureau were &#8216;the books.&#8217; The house books, the
village books, the visitor&#8217;s book, the clothing club
book, the letter book, the garden book, and last but
not least&mdash;the egg book! A certain amount of this
order and energy was imparted to her niece; the
mistress of the house knew how to make use of capable
subordinates&mdash;she would have made an efficient,
though not very popular or gracious abbess&mdash;was
thoroughly practical, and far-reaching&mdash;and particularly
prided herself on her sense of justice!</p>

<p>As it happened to be good hunting weather, and an
open winter, she left Letty at home as often as three
days a week, to act as regent, answer messages, visit
the greenhouses, and the poultry-yard, attend the
sewing club, and exercise the dogs.</p>

<p>Colonel Fenchurch had suggested that his niece
should learn to ride. He had even put her up on old
Playboy, and taken her round the fields with a leading-rein,
declaring that &#8220;the girl really had the riding flair&mdash;it
was her Irish blood no doubt; she was not a bit
afraid, and stuck on like a leech,&#8221; but his wife had
negatived the idea with prompt decision.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_19"></a>[19]</span>&#8220;No, no,&#8221; she replied; &#8220;if Letty began to ride,
she&#8217;d be wanting a hunter next, and this winter has
been so frightfully expensive, what with the new flues
in the greenhouse, and the kitchen range, and then I
must get her some frocks for Christmas and the balls.
She has nothing now, but hideous German clothes&mdash;her
school-room horrors&mdash;but next year,&#8221; pursing up
her lips, &#8220;<i>perhaps</i>&mdash;we shall see!&#8221;</p>

<p>And meanwhile Colonel Fenchurch gave his niece riding
lessons on the sly; he took her out into the fields on
off days when his wife was buried in important letters,
and exercised the pony that in summer drew the garden
mower. (The Holt was celebrated for its lawns of
beautiful old turf.) Letty found her gaunt, hard-featured
aunt both cold and unresponsive&mdash;the typical
English character&mdash;but oh, so marvellously clever!
As for her uncle&mdash;who was of her own blood&mdash;she
adored him, and manifested this affection in many
pretty ways; brought him his pipe and matches,
folded up his gloves and mufflers, ran for his cap or
hunting-crop. Tom Fenchurch liked it; it warmed his
old heart to see this charming girl waiting upon him so
eagerly; but his wife contemplated such attentions
with a frosty eye. In her opinion, Letty was too impulsive
and gushing; and she gave her sundry sharp
hints and raps, generally accepted in silence and
humility&mdash;for all her life long the girl was accustomed
to the yoke of obedience. Her mental attitude was
another affair, and though she loved her uncle, sad to
relate niece Letty was now beginning to detest her aunt.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_20"></a>[20]</span>Accepting Letty as a mere child, and no more, Mrs.
Fenchurch was astonished to discover that she was
highly accomplished (but why not? She had been at
school since she was five years old). She played music
at sight, was an excellent German scholar, spoke French
fluently, and executed most delicate embroideries&mdash;but
was deplorably ignorant as to the cutting out and manufacture
of garments, that were desirable and useful for
the clothing club. It was evident that to her, life outside
school and school routine was an absolutely unknown
land. She had never seen a Meet, never been to a ball,
or taken part in any social festivity. However all
that would come in good time; meanwhile the girl
was no trouble in the house, and proved surprisingly
docile; never advanced opinions of her own, and did
precisely as she was told. This aspect of her character
appealed to Mrs. Fenchurch; there was nothing she
enjoyed so keenly as settling the minds, and arranging
the plans of others; and Letty, so to speak, left her
life, her aims, and her future, entirely at her aunt&#8217;s disposal.
Her will was really too flexible, she had no self-confidence,
and in the anatomy of her individuality
there was no such article as the proverbial backbone!</p>

<p>Mrs. Hesketh, who had taken one of her rare fancies
to her cousin&#8217;s niece, invited her frequently to tea. It
amused and interested her to sound the depths of this
transparent young soul&mdash;to endeavour to draw out
the ideas of sweet seventeen.</p>

<p>&#8220;My dear child, you are charming,&#8221; she declared,
&#8220;and you are accomplished, but you cannot possibly go<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_21"></a>[21]</span>
through life without a mind and opinion of your own!
When I called to take you for a drive the other day,
you could not positively say yes or no&mdash;but shall I?
And then &#8216;Perhaps I&#8217;d better not,&#8217; and then &#8216;I&#8217;m not
sure if aunt won&#8217;t want me when she comes in,&#8217; and
again, &#8216;I&#8217;d like to go above all things, but I&#8217;m afraid
I&#8217;ve kept you so long that I won&#8217;t have time to get
ready now.&#8217; And at the end, just as I was getting into
the carriage, &#8216;Oh, how I wish I was going with you!&#8217;
Now if you continue like this&mdash;always standing between
two forked roads, what will become of you?
At present your aunt decides, but you cannot always
be a tender plant, clinging to a stout support, can you?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;No,&#8221; Letty replied; &#8220;I see what you mean, and
I feel it myself; but all my days have been ordered
for me; my clothes have been chosen, my letters read,
my books and companions have been the choice of
others; I have always walked in the path that was
traced for me, and I seem to expect a guiding hand.
If I ever had any will of my own&mdash;I believe it <i>died</i>
years ago.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Look here, my good girl,&#8221; said Mrs. Hesketh impatiently,
&#8220;if you have no will of your own, you must
grow one! Now I will plant a little seed. You are
asked to sing in the Parish Room on Saturday at the
Penny Reading. I hear that your answer, since the
matter has been left to you, is undecided.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Yes.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Tell me honestly, would you like to sing&mdash;or are
you too nervous?&#8221;</p>



<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_22"></a>[22]</span>&#8220;I am not the least nervous. I have been accustomed
to sing and play at school concerts for years.
I was quite a star!&#8221; and she laughed gaily; &#8220;and I
really would like to sing on Saturday if I thought it
would give people pleasure; but I have a sort
of suspicion, that Aunt Dorothy would rather I
didn&#8217;t!&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;That&#8217;s imagination,&#8221; protested Mrs. Hesketh.
&#8220;Dorothy knows we are badly off for performers, much
less stars. It isn&#8217;t as if this was to be a big public
performance; there will only be the village folk that
you see every day, the parson, the doctor, and myself.
Now, Letty, look me straight in the face and tell me,
do you wish to give these poor people a little pleasure?
Will you sing? There must be no shilly-shallying&mdash;it&#8217;s
yes or no&mdash;now.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Then,&#8221; lifting her laughing eyes, &#8220;yes.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;That&#8217;s right. Just go over to my writing-table
and write a note to Mr. Denton, and tell him that you
will sing two songs with pleasure&mdash;you can drop it
at the Rectory as you pass by.&#8221;</p>

<p>Letty rose and did as she was told, with her usual
docile obedience, and presently returned with a note
in her hand.</p>

<p>&#8220;Ah-ha!&#8221; said Mrs. Hesketh, giving her a sharp
look, &#8220;thus we have planted the first seed!&#8221;</p>

<p>Saturday evening arrived, the Parish Room was
packed to the doors and window-sills, and there was a
good deal of clapping when Miss Glyn, radiantly pretty
in her white school frock, was led upon the platform<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_23"></a>[23]</span>
by the Rector. Her aunt, sitting in the front row,
looked distinctly grim. Letty&#8217;s instinct was correct;
it was true that she had been fiercely if secretly opposed
to this exhibition! she did not wish to see the girl
brought forward&mdash;at least not yet: Colonel Fenchurch,
on the other hand, was the embodiment of triumphant
expectation, and was prepared to lead the <i>claque</i>.</p>

<p>When the prelude on the battered village piano had
ceased, Miss Glyn opened her pretty mouth, and began
to sing &#8220;The Sands of Dee.&#8221;</p>

<p>Her voice was exquisite; honey-sweet, and full of
restrained passion. She gave this most beautiful
tragic song, with extraordinary dramatic expression,
and yet in a simple, natural fashion, from the authoritative&mdash;</p>

<p class="center">&#8220;Go, Mary, call the cattle home,&#8221;</p>

<p>till where the last words died away in a tremulous, half-stifled
sob.</p>

<p>When she ceased, there was an awestruck breathless
silence; in fact, you might have heard the fall of the
proverbial pin.</p>

<p>What sort of singing was this? people asked themselves.
Something new; something that gripped your
heart-strings, something wonderful! Then came
thunders of applause, shouts and hammerings and
stamping with sticks and feet, such as never had been
heard within the walls of the Parish School-house,
yells of &#8216;Encore!&#8217; to which the singer smilingly
acceded and gave them &#8220;Robin Adair.&#8221; Again her
audience listened with rapture.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_24"></a>[24]</span>Mrs. Fenchurch was equally astonished, and annoyed,
by the composure and aplomb of a girl who in every-day
life was so timid and retiring. To-night, she presented
the confidence and air of a prima donna of
twenty years&#8217; experience; but Letty was for once upon
solid ground; she knew her own capabilities, and the
radiant and acclaimed Miss Glyn, was a totally different
individual from the timid, wistful girl, who suffered
herself to be scolded and hustled about The Holt.</p>

<p>In short, that evening Miss Glyn made her name,
not only as a marvellous singer with a voice which the
baker&#8217;s wife&mdash;who had been to London&mdash;compared
to Patti&#8217;s&mdash;but also as a beauty!</p>

<p>Her fame now gradually oozed through the stolid
clay surroundings, and reached villages and market
towns that were afar off. These learnt, that the prettiest
girl in the whole country-side was a little slip of seventeen,
who lived in Thornby village.</p>

<p>It was about this period that Mrs. Fenchurch began
to feel seriously jealous of her bright and charming
inmate; so popular with the neighbours, with the
household, and last, but not least&mdash;her husband.</p>

<p>She hated to see her looking at him, or speaking to
him, with eyes at once innocent and caressing; and as
for Tom, he was simply idiotic about his niece; from
time to time, he would come into her bedroom, dressed,
or half-dressed, as the case might be, to rave of Letty&#8217;s
perfections and beauty; to descant on her sweet
disposition, and to wind up by declaring, &#8220;She&#8217;s like
sunshine in the house.&#8221; The poor man was undoubtedly<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_25"></a>[25]</span>
bewitched, and his enthusiasm received
but a tepid acknowledgment. (If you really wish to
know a woman&#8217;s bad points&mdash;praise her to another.)</p>

<p>His wife very solemnly and deliberately, enumerated
the girl&#8217;s many failings. She was unpunctual, she
was forgetful, she was untidy&mdash;and she was weak. As
for him, he was too silly for anything, and was only
making himself absolutely ridiculous, and the laughing-stock
of the whole neighbourhood!</p>

<p>But as it happened few of the Neighbourhood
(spelt with a capital N) had beheld Colonel Fenchurch&#8217;s
young relative. County folk do not visit in winter; the
great summer gatherings, at cricket matches, tennis,
garden parties, and picnics, were over: friends and
acquaintances, for the most part, met and exchanged
news and gossip in the hunting-field, and for this reason
the beautiful flower blooming at The Holt, was so far
blushing unseen.</p>

<p>It was Letty&#8217;s daily task to take the dogs out for
exercise; Sam, the apoplectic pug, Jerry, the impetuous
Irish setter, and Locky, the aggressive Aberdeen.
One afternoon, as she was plodding along through a
muddy lane accompanied by her usual escort, she
heard the horn in the distance, and presently the
trotting of horses, who were evidently approaching
rapidly. And yes, here, coming round a sharp bend,
was the whole red-coated hunt.</p>

<p>She hurried into the field with her precious charges,
and snatching up the snorting and bewildered pug,
established herself behind the gate, from where she<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_26"></a>[26]</span>
could safely watch the cavalcade, as it splashed and
pounded by.</p>

<p>A stout, dark-eyed man on a magnificent horse,
glanced at her casually, then stared hard&mdash;finally he
looked back. This individual was Mr. Blagdon, who
was enjoying a day&#8217;s run, and rather middling sport
with the Brakesby pack. He was struck by the figure
at the gate; a girl with a beautiful eager face, holding
in her arms a struggling dog; but although he made
prompt enquiries, not one among his many acquaintances
could tell him the name of the young lady in the
blue cloak, whom they had passed in Rapstone lane.</p>

<h2 class="nobreak">CHAPTER III</h2>
</div>


<p class="drop-cap">CHRISTMAS was approaching, and so far, Miss
Glyn&#8217;s acquaintance was confined to the village
of Thornby. Now and then her aunt and uncle went
from home for a dine and a shoot, and on these occasions,
Mrs. Hesketh took charge of the young lady, who
was delighted to be her guest. At Oldcourt the atmosphere
was reposeful, the surroundings subdued and
luxurious, and life was leisured. Here it was seemingly
&#8216;always afternoon.&#8217; Letty was not sure that she
would enjoy it as a permanence; perhaps there was
too much of the hothouse in the air, but it was an
agreeable change from The Holt, where it was figuratively
a perpetual Monday, with a large washing on
hand!</p>

<p>Cousin Maudie, an accomplished musician, encouraged
her guest to practise, played her accompaniments,
and delighted in her voice. Now Mrs. Fenchurch
hated &#8216;squalling,&#8217; had no ear, and was actually
proud of the fact, that she only knew &#8220;God Save the
King&#8221; by seeing people rise to their feet! Mrs. Hesketh
also loved books, and the tables at Oldcourt were loaded
with the newest and best publications, whether in
magazine, pamphlet, or book form. Letty laid greedy
hands on these, but her hostess prudently withdrew<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_28"></a>[28]</span>
a certain amount&mdash;sociological and theological works&mdash;which
were not suitable reading for Sweet Seventeen.</p>

<p>Letty admired&mdash;and loved&mdash;her beautiful (if rather
faded) hostess, and the love and admiration were
mutual. The new-comer had also made friends with
the Vicar and his wife. Mr. Denton, a hale, active man
of fifty, much praised by his own flock, and respected
by others. Mrs. Denton, though she had lost the use
of her limbs through sleeping in a damp bed, was her
husband&#8217;s helper in the parish, and it was surprising
what an amount of work, correspondence, and interviews
centred round her sofa. She was a frail, delicate
Irishwoman, with a sense of humour, a cheerful disposition,
and a warm heart. Both she and her husband had
taken a fancy to the &#8216;little girl at The Holt,&#8217; as they
called her. She reminded them of their own little girl,
who had married and gone to India; to see Letty flitting
about the drawing-room, or seated in Mabel&#8217;s chair,
was a sight that gave them sincere pleasure. And the
child was so simple and unaffected, she looked into
one&#8217;s face with such sweet candid eyes, and was ever
ready and glad to carry a message, sing, play, or read,
to the invalid, keenly interested in little village events,
and the weekly Madras letter&mdash;all she asked for in
return, was to be liked!</p>

<p>In a surprisingly short time, this attractive stranger
had entirely wound herself into the affections of the
Dentons; her visits were not frequent, but on hunting
days, after she had exercised the dogs, she would turn
into the Rectory drawing-room, and pour out tea.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_29"></a>[29]</span>Immediately before Christmas, Mrs. Fenchurch,
who was absorbed in her correspondence, sent Letty
down to the Rectory with a note. When she arrived
there it was still teatime, and she was surprised to
find that Mrs. Denton had a guest, a good-looking
young man, who appeared to find himself completely
at home, since he was sitting on the end of the sofa,
nursing the Rectory cat.</p>

<p>&#8220;Oh, Letty, so there you are!&#8221; said Mrs. Denton.
&#8220;Let me introduce my nephew, Lancelot Lumley.
He has come to spend Christmas with us. Lancelot,
this is Miss Glyn&mdash;you have heard of her?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;We have met before,&#8221; he said eagerly; &#8220;a couple
of months ago, I think, in that railway shake-up?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Yes,&#8221; she assented, for here was the very travelling
companion, who had worn the buffer coat, &#8220;in the
train.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;It might have been a bad business,&#8221; he continued,
and described the incident to his aunt.</p>

<p>&#8220;I suppose it happened when you were on your
way home?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Yes, I took first leave this year, and I&#8217;m sorry to
say I have nearly come to the end of it.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;And give us only two days, Lance&mdash;you ought to
be ashamed of yourself!&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;The fact is, Frances wouldn&#8217;t let me off, and
Colonel Kingsnorth lent me a hunter; we have had
some ripping good runs.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Ah!&#8221; said his aunt, &#8220;I think it was the hunter
that wouldn&#8217;t let you off.&#8221; Then, turning to Letty,<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_30"></a>[30]</span>
she explained, &#8220;My brother-in-law, Lancelot&#8217;s father,
has a living twenty miles from here, at a place called
Sharsley; but he might as well be in London, for it&#8217;s
so dreadfully out of the way. We don&#8217;t see one another
half a dozen times in the year. This note,&#8221; holding it
up to Letty, &#8220;is from your aunt; she says she is so
desperately busy, that she can&#8217;t help with the church
decorations. You know she has always undertaken
the pulpit, she sends you as her deputy, and will
supply the usual pots of palms and chrysanthemums.
Lancelot,&#8221; looking over at her nephew, &#8220;I intend to
make use of you&mdash;you and Miss Glyn must do the
pulpit between you.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;All right,&#8221; he answered, &#8220;I am agreeable, if Miss
Glyn is; but let me warn you that I have no more
idea of decorating than I have of making a watch.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I am afraid I am not much good either,&#8221; supplemented
the girl; &#8220;I&#8217;ve had no practice.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Miss Glyn left school two months ago,&#8221; explained
Mrs. Denton.</p>

<p>&#8220;Were you sorry?&#8221; enquired the young man, looking
over at her.</p>

<p>&#8220;Yes,&#8221; then with a burst of artless honesty&mdash;&#8220;I
have been to school nearly all my life.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;She is coming out at the Hunt Ball early in January,&#8221;
announced Mrs. Denton.</p>

<p>&#8220;Yes, and I won&#8217;t know a single creature at it!&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Oh, your aunt will find you plenty of partners.
You could not be in better hands. I feel sure she will
make a most capable chaperon. It is miraculous how<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_31"></a>[31]</span>
she manages to get rid of the most hopeless articles at
bazaars. No one can resist her!&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;And you think she will get <i>me</i> off!&#8221; Letty
laughed, and her laugh was joyous.</p>

<p>&#8220;Not a doubt of it! Sooner than see you sitting
out, she&#8217;d dance with you herself. And about her
note&mdash;so it is all settled, Letty. You will be down
here at eleven o&#8217;clock to-morrow; bring a large ball
of twine, and a pair of scissors, and Miss Hoare, the
schoolmistress, will start you. Remember I shall
expect you and Lancelot to turn out the most beautiful
pulpit that has ever been seen in Thornby.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I can only say that I will do my best,&#8221; said Letty,
rising.</p>

<p>&#8220;What! you are not going yet?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I am afraid I must. Aunt Dorothy has quantities
of things she wants me to do this evening&mdash;there&#8217;s the
ticketing for the Christmas Tree.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Oh, poor child, I don&#8217;t envy you,&#8221; said Mrs.
Denton with upraised hands. &#8220;Well, in that case, I
won&#8217;t detain you&mdash;Lancelot will escort you home,&#8221;
and subsequently he and the young lady left the room
together; she protesting, he assuring her that if she
didn&#8217;t mind, he would be glad to make the stroll an
excuse for a pipe. Strange to record, until that evening,
Letty had never realised how short was the distance
between the Rectory and The Holt! Here in the
entrance hall she encountered her aunt; Mrs. Fen,
who was overwhelmed with affairs, wore a frowning
brow, and carried half a dozen parcels and a Directory.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_32"></a>[32]</span>&#8220;Who was that I heard speaking just now?&#8221; she
enquired sharply; &#8220;it sounded like a man&#8217;s voice?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;It was only Mr. Lumley, Mrs. Denton&#8217;s nephew;
he walked home with me.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Oh, so he is here, is he?&#8221; she remarked over her
shoulder, as she swept into the smoking-room.</p>

<p>&#8220;Is that Lancelot Lumley you are talking of?&#8221;
enquired Colonel Fenchurch, who was reading. &#8220;I
suppose he bicycled over to spend Christmas&mdash;they
find it hatefully dull without Mabel. You&#8217;d better ask
him up to lunch, or something.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I think at this time of the year, when one has so
much to do,&#8221; and Mrs. Fenchurch shot a glance at her
husband, and then at Letty, &#8220;people don&#8217;t expect to
be entertained.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Of course not,&#8221; agreed the Colonel; &#8220;I expect
Lumley to entertain <i>me</i>&mdash;you forget that he is in my
old regiment. I want to hear how the old corps is
getting along. To think that a boy who joined
a few years before I left, is commanding them
now!&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Oh, very well, Tom, then do as you like&mdash;ask him
up to lunch or dinner.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;He is an awfully good sort,&#8221; Colonel Fenchurch
explained to Letty; &#8220;one of my favourites&mdash;none of
your &#8216;haw-haw&#8217; chaps. His father is a poor parson,
and this boy has worked himself on&mdash;getting scholarships;
he passed first out of Sandhurst. I believe he
scarcely cost old Lumley a ten-pound note&mdash;he&#8217;s the
hope of the family&mdash;such a good&mdash;&mdash;&#8221;</p>



<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_33"></a>[33]</span>&#8220;There&mdash;there, Tom,&#8221; interrupted his wife, &#8220;that&#8217;s
<i>quite</i> enough about young Lumley! He doesn&#8217;t
interest Letty, or me. Now, Letty, I can&#8217;t have you
standing idle, run away, take off your things, and
go out into the laundry and help Fletcher to ticket
the things for the Christmas Tree.&#8221;</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>It is extraordinary the amount of intimacy that can
result from a mutual undertaking, in which two young
people are engaged. After Mr. Lumley and Miss Glyn
had finished the pulpit&mdash;which to do them justice was
a work of great labour crowned with success&mdash;they felt
as if they had been acquainted, not for hours, but for
weeks. This impression, was further strengthened when
they met at dinner. Letty, wearing her plain white
school frock, the young man looking handsome and
well groomed in the regulation swallow tail. It transpired,
that they had been engaged in decorating the
church, and Mrs. Fenchurch and her husband might
have been a little surprised at finding they already
knew one another so well, had not the Colonel been
absorbed in regimental stories, and Mrs. Fenchurch
mentally composing an important letter, that was to
go by that night&#8217;s post.</p>

<p>After dinner, when Colonel Fenchurch and his guest
had each smoked an excellent cigar, the former said:</p>

<p>&#8220;Now you must come into the drawing-room and
hear my niece sing,&#8221; and in spite of her aunt&#8217;s protestations
that Letty had too much to do, and she<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_34"></a>[34]</span>
could not possibly spare her, she was led to the piano
and enchanted her listeners with two or three of
Schumann&#8217;s songs, and Gounod&#8217;s &#8220;Ave Maria,&#8221; and
the extraordinary impression that this beautiful girl
had made upon a susceptible young man, was now
complete.</p>

<p>Lancelot Lumley looked and listened in silence, and
surrendered his heart without a further struggle. Although
he knew, that it was absolute madness for him
to think of Miss Glyn as anything but a star that dwelt
apart! He had his way to make&mdash;she was penniless&mdash;her
face, her lovely face, was her fortune.</p>

<p>On Christmas morning as he sat alone in the Rectory
pew, his eyes often wandered across the aisle, in search
of Miss Glyn. How her sweet voice appeared to rise
and swell above all others; and to the infatuated lover
it seemed, that the beautiful fair-haired girl, with the
rapt, devotional expression, was the embodiment of
a Herald angel! When the service was over, Lumley
met his angel in the porch; here they exchanged
seasonable greetings and received congratulations on
their joint embellishment of the pulpit. Then, very
late on Christmas night, Lumley ran up to The Holt to
bid them all good-bye. He was hurrying home early
the next morning, as his leave had nearly expired;
but brief as this visit was, he found an opportunity
to say to Letty:</p>

<p>&#8220;I hear you are coming out at the Hunt Ball the
end of January? Perhaps I can get leave for it. I
generally try to put in an appearance&mdash;you know it&#8217;s<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_35"></a>[35]</span>
in my part of the world, and I see all my friends
there.&#8221;</p>

<p>The real gist of these explanations and excuses was
summed up at the end of the sentence:</p>

<p>&#8220;I say, Miss Glyn, if I <i>do</i> manage to turn up&mdash;will
you keep a couple of waltzes for me?&#8221;</p>

<p>At which request the young lady coloured, and
replied:</p>

<p>&#8220;Yes, with pleasure.&#8221;</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>By and by the little seed planted by Mrs. Hesketh
began to peep above ground, and Letty Glyn&#8217;s will
came to life. It made its first appearance on the arrival
of certain patterns from London, and the question of
a selection from among these, for a best afternoon,
and two evening dresses. Mrs. Fenchurch was not disposed
to allow her niece any choice in the matter.
After looking at them critically, and fingering the
textures, she said:</p>

<p>&#8220;The dark green will make you a nice afternoon
frock; and you will want a smart black evening dress,
and a ball-gown. Fletcher can make them all with a
little assistance from Mrs. Cope in the village. For
the ball dress, I fancy this white brocade trimmed with
apple-green satin. How do you think that will look?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I don&#8217;t think I should care about it,&#8221; replied Letty.</p>

<p>&#8220;What!&#8221; exclaimed her aunt, staring at her in
glassy amazement, &#8220;it would be charming. I remember
I had a ball dress something like it years ago.&#8221;</p>



<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_36"></a>[36]</span>&#8220;But fashions have changed since then,&#8221; objected
the girl; &#8220;don&#8217;t you think a dress for a d&eacute;butante
should be soft, and all white, with perhaps a little
silver?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Now, my dear, what <i>can</i> you possibly know about
it?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Not much, I admit; we were very plainly dressed
at school, and our clothes, I must confess, were dowdy,
yet now and then, one had a chance of seeing what
was worn&mdash;for instance, at the opera.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Do you mean on the stage?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Oh no, I mean the lovely elegant Court ladies that
were in the boxes.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Then what is your own idea?&#8221; her aunt enquired
sarcastically.</p>

<p>&#8220;I should like a soft white <i>cr&ecirc;pe</i> over white satin&mdash;with
some silver embroidery on the body.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Yes, I daresay you would!&#8221; sneered Mrs. Fenchurch;
&#8220;why the materials alone of such a dress
would cost at least ten pounds.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I have ten pounds,&#8221; was the unexpected reply;
then, colouring a little in answer to her aunt&#8217;s sharp
interrogative glance, &#8220;uncle gave it to me for a
Christmas box.&#8221;</p>

<p>For a moment Mrs. Fenchurch was speechless; she
had never heard a word of this present, and to tell
the truth, Uncle Tom when he placed the ten-pound
note in the girl&#8217;s hand had said:</p>

<p>&#8220;This is just a little secret between you and me.&#8221;
Now it was a secret no longer!</p>



<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_37"></a>[37]</span>Mrs. Fenchurch&#8217;s feelings were altogether too much
for her. She hastily collected her patterns, rose, and
without a word flounced out of the room.</p>

<p>It seemed to Mrs. Fenchurch, that this simple schoolgirl
was obtaining an extraordinary and disastrous
ascendancy not only in the village, but in the household.
The servants&mdash;little country chits, whom she
had herself trained since they went out of pinafores&mdash;would
do anything for Miss Glyn. Sam the pug (Mrs.
Fenchurch&#8217;s own private dog) had handed over his
heart to the girl, and attached himself to her exclusively&mdash;and
as for Tom, he was her slave! It was
Letty, Letty, Letty, all day; and when this girl began
to make her appearance in a wider circle, would she,
Mrs. Fenchurch&mdash;influential Mrs. Fenchurch&mdash;have to
take a back seat?</p>

<p>It was also evident to Mrs. Fenchurch, that of late
this interloper had developed in many ways, and was
inclined to enter into conversation, and even to offer
opinions! This sort of thing must be nipped without
delay. Once she began to take an inch, it would soon
become an ell&mdash;the inch, would be the selection of
her ball-gown. It was too ridiculous that a girl of
seventeen who had never been to a dance in her
life, should dare to set up her taste in opposition
to her own.</p>

<p>With a stern resolve implanted in her mind, Mrs.
Fenchurch sat down and wrote off to London, ordering
materials, which included the white brocade, and
green satin trimming.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_38"></a>[38]</span>In two or three days the order had arrived, and after
breakfast, she summoned Letty into her bedroom&mdash;a
delightful chamber with large bow windows and
bright chintzes, facing full south, and overlooking
the lawns.</p>

<p>&#8220;You want to see me, aunt?&#8221; she asked as
she entered (inwardly quaking) and awaited instructions.</p>

<p>In the long glass which faced them from floor to
ceiling, Mrs. Fenchurch beheld the full-length reflections
of her niece and herself; she, in a rough tweed gown,
spare, weather-beaten, long-nosed, elderly; the girl,
in a cheap blue serge, slim, erect, beautiful as the morning&mdash;and
with all her best days to come! A sharp
spasm of anger and jealousy darted through her mind.
Alas! alas! Her own best days had gone by. She,
Dorothy Fenchurch, was entering on the season of
the sere and yellow leaf&mdash;and was conscious of an
agonising self-pity.</p>

<p>&#8220;Oh yes, it&#8217;s about your ball dress. Here,&#8221; tearing
open her parcel, &#8220;are the materials&mdash;they came to-day.&#8221;</p>

<p>It was undeniably a heavy and matronly brocade
that she unfolded, and as for the green satin ribbon,
whatever it might look at night, it was hideous by day!</p>

<p>&#8220;Oh!&#8221; exclaimed the girl, &#8220;so you got the brocade
after all&mdash;and I have sent for the white <i>cr&ecirc;pe</i>.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;You have sent for the white <i>cr&ecirc;pe</i>&mdash;without consulting
<i>me</i>!&#8221; repeated Mrs. Fenchurch, speaking as
it were in capital letters.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_39"></a>[39]</span>&#8220;Well, you see uncle gave me the money to spend
as I pleased. The <i>cr&ecirc;pe</i> has come too, and is really
lovely. May I show it to you?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;No, I don&#8217;t want to see it! I am amazed at your
daring to do such a thing as order a dress without my
permission. One thing I can promise you, and that is,
that it won&#8217;t be made up! You go to the ball&mdash;if you
go at all&mdash;in a gown of my selection.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Then, I think,&#8221; and the girl became very red,
&#8220;that I will stay at home. Yes&mdash;I should look too
ridiculous.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;You will look exactly as <i>I</i> choose!&#8221; declared Mrs.
Fenchurch, suddenly losing her self-control; the
smouldering resentment which had been gathering for
weeks now bursting into flames; a strange, wild fury,
all the long-pent-up grievances, annoyances, jealousies,
finding outlet at last. It must be confessed that
just at the moment, she was suffering torture from
neuralgia in her face&mdash;the result of long rides in
piercing cold, or damp evenings, when the day&#8217;s
sport was over.</p>

<p>&#8220;May I ask if you understand your position here?
Do you realise that but for me, you would be now
out earning your bread as a nursery governess&mdash;are
you aware, that ever since you were born, your father&#8217;s
people have never given you a single penny, and that
all the burden of your maintenance has fallen on us&mdash;or
rather, I should say, on <i>me</i>? And here, instead of
being grateful for a happy home, and for every luxury
and indulgence, you are setting yourself up, and saying<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_40"></a>[40]</span>
what you will wear, and defying me to my face. Go
to your room&mdash;I hate the sight of you!&#8221;</p>

<p>Letty had listened to this bitter indictment with
rapidly changing colour; she knew that her aunt had
never cared for her; but that she absolutely hated her,
and felt her to be a burden and an interloper, came as
a revelation. She left the room in silence, and Mrs.
Fenchurch, who was trembling with passion, snatched
up the brocade, carried it into the maid&#8217;s working-room,
and commanded her to lose no time about
making it up for Miss Glyn. But afterwards, when
she had cooled, Mrs. Fen began to realise that
she had gone too far; for once in her life she
acknowledged to herself, that she had said too
much.</p>

<p>Colonel Fenchurch was surprised and concerned when
he saw his niece at lunch with a very white face, and
very red eyes. She ate scarcely a morsel, and seemed
to find considerable difficulty in swallowing or speaking.
On his wife&#8217;s brow there sat a heavy cloud, and he
noticed the servants glancing significantly at one
another&mdash;something had happened&mdash;there had been
a blow up! But he, being a cautious and somewhat
nervous little gentleman, talked about the weather
and a lame horse, and withdrew as soon as possible
into the shelter of his smoking-room; where he consoled
himself with a recent copy of the <i>Field</i>, and a good
cigar.</p>

<p>During the afternoon, Mrs. Fenchurch, having
fortified herself with a large glass of port and quinine,<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_41"></a>[41]</span>
climbed up to the top of the house, to make the <i>amende</i>
to her niece.</p>

<p>&#8220;Well, Letty,&#8221; she began as she entered, &#8220;I am
sorry we have had a difference of opinion; but I
suppose you will allow that you are little more than a
child, and that <i>I</i> am a woman of experience, and should
know what should be done, and worn, better than
yourself?&#8221;</p>

<p>Letty stood up, her lips twitched, and her eyes filled
with tears as she answered:</p>

<p>&#8220;I am sorry, aunt, that you are displeased with me,
and I&mdash;I&mdash;suppose I was impertinent. I meant no
harm in sending for the <i>cr&ecirc;pe</i> dress, and indeed I
thought it would save you buying my ball-gown.&#8221;</p>

<p>This was precisely the attitude of which Mrs. Fenchurch
most warmly approved, and as the girl looked
completely cowed, she said:</p>

<p>&#8220;I am sorry that I lost my temper&mdash;so let us make
it up; and as you have bought the white <i>cr&ecirc;pe</i>, you
shall wear it. The other will come in later,&#8221; and
having offered, what she considered, a most remarkable
concession, Mrs. Fen kissed her niece sharply, and
walked downstairs. After she had departed, Letty
stood listening to her descending footsteps; somehow
her aunt&#8217;s footsteps, coming or going, invariably made
her heart flutter like that of some terrified animal.
When the last sound had died away, she flung herself
down upon her bed. She didn&#8217;t care about the ball,
or the <i>cr&ecirc;pe</i> dress&mdash;or anything! She was an interloper;
no one wanted her. How bitter it was, to eat<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_42"></a>[42]</span>
bread that was begrudged. In what shape or form
could she ever find release?</p>

<p>It was agonising to reflect, that she might go on living
month after month, and year after year, under the
roof of a woman who had called her a pauper, and a
burden.</p>

<h2 class="nobreak">CHAPTER IV</h2>
</div>


<p class="drop-cap">THE great day dawned at last; the day of the
Hunt Ball, which took place annually in the
Town Hall of Ridgefield, and was attended by everybody
who was anyone&mdash;and many nobodies.</p>

<p>Letty&#8217;s white <i>cr&ecirc;pe</i>, completed with her assistance,
was charming; soft, girlish, and yet distinguished&mdash;for
her mental eye had copied it from one of the trousseau
gowns of a young and royal princess.</p>

<p>Mrs. Fenchurch, who was not remarkable for her
taste in dress, wore a ginger-coloured velvet, with opal
ornaments; but she carried herself with dignity and
looked a Claremont, and a personage! Colonel Fenchurch,
in his pink coat, black satin breeches, and neat
silk stockings, squeezed himself into the brougham,
with many compliments for his two companions.</p>

<p>The town of Ridgefield was eight miles away, and as
the family bowled along the road at a steady pace, the
Colonel dozed, his wife meditated with closed eyes;
but their niece all the time stared out on the brown
hedges and bare ditches, which were illuminated by
the flashing carriage lamps. Of what was she thinking?
Was it possible that she was wondering if Lancelot
Lumley would be at the ball?</p>

<p>The Holt party were somewhat late arrivals, and<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_44"></a>[44]</span>
when the carriage drew up under an awning in front
of the Town Hall, the first to step out and run the
gauntlet of many spectators was Colonel Fenchurch.
He had a remarkably well-turned leg, and looked particularly
spruce. His wife followed with impressive
deliberation, and last of all came the young lady in
white. Her appearance was greeted with a loud
murmur, as she floated up the steps in the wake of her
relations.</p>

<p>As they left the cloak-room, Mrs. Fenchurch, who
had received many greetings, was confronted with a
lady in a superb sable cloak; a handsome woman with
flashing black eyes, and wearing in her hair a magnificent
diamond ornament.</p>

<p>&#8220;Oh, Mrs. Fen,&#8221; she exclaimed, &#8220;how are you?
Going strong, eh?&#8221; Then her eyes suddenly alighted
on Mrs. Fen&#8217;s companion, and she gave her a hard,
critical stare.</p>

<p>&#8220;Ah, I suppose this little girl is the niece? going to
take her preliminary canter?&#8221; and with a patronising
nod, she passed on to the dressing-room.</p>

<p>Letty encountered her aunt&#8217;s eye, who, seizing her
arm to lead her forward, said:</p>

<p>&#8220;That is Mrs. Flashman, a wonderful rider, but an
odious, detestable creature, who slams gates, jostles you
at fences, and swears at her horses, and her servants.&#8221;</p>

<p>Two minutes later, Miss Glyn found herself with a
programme in her hand, standing in the ball-room.
This was beautifully decorated, a military band was
established in the gallery, and the sides of the room<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_45"></a>[45]</span>
and a sort of platform at the upper end were densely
crowded with guests. Others were promenading up
and down impatiently awaiting the next waltz. Many
neighbours had brought large house-parties, whose
smart gowns and splendid jewels, gave an air of
London society to the Brakesley Hunt Ball.</p>

<p>Mrs. Fenchurch paced slowly towards the dais. On
her way, she encountered several acquaintances, and
introduced her niece to Lord Seafield&mdash;a thin young
man with a very prominent nose and no chin&mdash;to Sir
Edgar Broome, the M.F.H., and to the Dowager
Duchess of Campshire.</p>

<p>Before ascending the platform, she was accosted
by Lancelot Lumley, who came forward eagerly, programme
in hand, and said:</p>

<p>&#8220;I hope Miss Glyn can spare me a couple of
waltzes?&#8221;</p>

<p>Miss Glyn promptly produced her programme, and he
scribbled his initials before three. The next, which
was just beginning, the one before supper, and number
twelve.</p>

<p>Mrs. Fenchurch looked on with glum disapproval.
<i>Three</i> dances to an impecunious subaltern! But she
could not offer any audible objection, and as the band
struck up he said:</p>

<p>&#8220;Shall we make a start now before the room gets
crammed?&#8221; and light as a feather the young lady was
whirled away, and the elder was compelled to mount
to the platform alone. But from this and other coigns
of vantage, the extraordinary beauty of Miss Glyn was<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_46"></a>[46]</span>
soon remarked. Indeed, her own chaperon, as she
surveyed her through her best gold glasses, assured
herself, that she had never until now realised the girl&#8217;s
astonishing good looks! Of course dress went a long
way, so did youth&mdash;and candle-light; but Letty&#8217;s
profile was perfect, her complexion, the shape of her
face, the setting on of her head, were beyond criticism&mdash;and
then her grace!</p>

<p>As Dorothy Fenchurch watched the white form
revolving round and round, she began to experience
an intoxicating sensation; the stimulating conviction
was borne in upon her, that she had a valuable prize
to offer in the marriage market!</p>

<p>Seen just at home, running about in her school
frocks and garden apron, Letty was merely a pretty
girl, with lots of hair, and a good complexion; here,
in the midst of the magnates of the land, she was the
beauty of the evening! People&mdash;her neighbours&mdash;gathered
about Mrs. Fenchurch and began to talk,
discussing local news, the recent weather, the various
notable magnates who had honoured the ball.</p>

<p>&#8220;I say, Mrs. Fen, have you noticed the lovely nymph
in white and silver?&#8221; enquired the Secretary of the
Hunt. &#8220;I haven&#8217;t seen anything so exquisite for
years; <i>do</i> let me show her to you?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;There is no occasion, thank you, she is my niece,
Miss Glyn,&#8221; proclaimed the uplifted aunt.</p>

<p>&#8220;What&mdash;your niece?&#8221; echoed a matron. &#8220;Why,
my dear lady, where have you kept her all this
time?&#8221;</p>



<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_47"></a>[47]</span>&#8220;She has only been with us about two months.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;And you have defrauded us of two months,&#8221; burst
in a young man. &#8220;Mrs. Fen, how dared you?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;No, no,&#8221; protested Mrs. Flashman of the bold eyes
and a scandalously <i>d&eacute;collet&eacute;</i> dress. &#8220;Mrs. Fenchurch
is a clever woman. She understands the art of an effective
surprise!&#8221;</p>

<p>By this time the music had ceased, and Miss Glyn,
a little breathless and looking radiantly happy, was
brought back to her aunt&mdash;now encompassed by a
number of men clamouring for introductions. In the
midst of this triumphant scene, a square-shouldered
individual, perfectly groomed, with the blue of his
strong beard showing through his heavy, clean-shaven
face, stepped up on the platform. It was the psychological
moment! Here was the girl he had noticed at
the gate, surrounded by competitive partners, and he
said to himself, &#8220;No wonder!&#8221; This dazzling vision
in white and silver, eclipsed every woman in the room!
He accosted Mrs. Fenchurch with unusual <i>empressement</i>,
and then glanced interrogatively at her companion.</p>

<p>&#8220;Oh, let me present you to my niece&mdash;Mr. Blagdon&mdash;Miss
Glyn,&#8221; she murmured with effusive haste.</p>

<p>&#8220;Got any dances to spare?&#8221; he asked with an off-hand
air.</p>

<p>&#8220;Yes,&#8221; she answered; &#8220;I have two or three left&mdash;but&mdash;&mdash;&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Are you engaged for the next?&#8221; he interrupted
brusquely.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_48"></a>[48]</span>As this happened to be a set of Lancers, she breathed
a reluctant &#8220;No.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Oh, then <i>I</i> may have it?&#8221; he declared, confronting
her with a bold and confident eye. As she
yielded her card, he wrote himself down for this, as
well as two others (which Letty had secretly been
keeping for Lancelot Lumley). &#8220;H. Blagdon&#8221; was
also marked before an extra; but a man with many
thousands a year is granted a liberal margin. Mrs.
Fenchurch was looking on; her eyes glittered, a real
colour came into her thin cheeks. Supposing that he
had taken a fancy to Letty? It would be too wonderful
to think of! The most promising suitor she had
allowed herself to expect, was some officer from a
neighbouring dep&ocirc;t; but then, until that evening she
had never fully understood the value of the treasure
she had hidden at The Holt. Now, her ambition,
determination, and energy, were stirred, and she was
resolved that Letty should make a <i>great</i> match.
Everyone knew that Hugo Blagdon &#8216;barred girls&#8217;:
he never noticed them, never danced with them&mdash;indeed,
he rarely danced at all&mdash;generally he sat in a
remote corner with some notorious married woman&mdash;yet
here he was, filling up the programme of her niece,
and devouring her shy beauty with his hard, bold eyes.</p>

<p>Undoubtedly most people liked to look at Letty.
Was there ever such a perfect little nose, such a
short upper lip, delicately cut mouth, or sweeping
black lashes?</p>

<p>Presently the Lancers struck up, and Blagdon, offering<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_49"></a>[49]</span>
his arm, conducted his partner down the room, as
it were in triumph; undoubtedly she was the star of
the evening! As he passed along, he noticed that the
eyes of everyone were fixed upon his companion. This
was just the sort of girl that would suit him for a wife!
a girl so remarkable, so absolutely perfect in appearance,
that all the jealous world would stare at her
open-mouthed.</p>

<p>Having invited an aristocratic <i>vis-&agrave;-vis</i>, they took
their places in a set and danced. Blagdon found Miss
Glyn shy&mdash;she had not much to say for herself. With
difficulty he gathered that she didn&#8217;t hunt, had only
lately left school, and was seventeen last birthday;
but it was sufficiently agreeable for him to feel that
she was the cynosure of all eyes, and that he was the
envy of every man in the room!</p>

<p>Mrs. Flashman, who was in the same set, swam
hither and thither in her gorgeous French gown, and
now and then darted glances of sarcastic amusement
at her friend Hugo and the little baby; and whispered
<i>en passant</i> in the Grand Chain:</p>

<p>&#8220;<i>Where</i> is the bread and butter?&#8221;</p>

<p>The remainder of that evening was, from her aunt&#8217;s
point of view, an uninterrupted triumph for Letty: a
number of influential people had begged to make her
acquaintance; envious and rancorous rivals&mdash;mothers
of large families, had uttered spiteful things about
Hugo Blagdon. He had taken her niece to supper,
had only danced with her that night, and when not
dancing, had posted himself where he could keep her<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_50"></a>[50]</span>
in view&mdash;all of which signs and tokens even the most
comatose chaperon could not fail to note! Oh, it
was undoubtedly a case.</p>

<p>Had Letty enjoyed her first ball? She was not sure.
She enjoyed dancing with Mr. Lumley and with various
other young men; she enjoyed the band, and the ices,
and loved dancing for dancing&#8217;s sake, but somehow
there seemed to be between Mr. Lumley and Mr.
Blagdon a sharp but secret conflict for her company.
When she was swinging round in the arms of Mr.
Lumley, she was aware that the other was watching
them closely; and when it was Blagdon&#8217;s dance he
stalked up and claimed her with an air of appropriation,
that she found both disagreeable and disconcerting.</p>

<p>However she danced the last waltz that evening
with the soldier&mdash;who informed her that he had come
all the way from Aldershot on purpose to claim her
promise! He was so good-looking, he had a charming
voice and such nice eyes; little Letty&#8217;s heart beat
quickly, and the colour came into her cheeks.</p>

<p>&#8220;Give my love to Aunt Harriet,&#8221; he said; &#8220;and
tell her that I will run over and see her before very
long, and stay three or four days.&#8221;</p>

<p>For a moment the girl felt ecstatically happy, inspired
by an unreasoning joy and strangely moved and uplifted;
but it was Mr. Blagdon who escorted her to
have a cup of soup at the buffet before she departed,
who stared at her with an expression that frightened
her, and who conducted her down to the entrance hall
through a long line of spectators. And never had<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_51"></a>[51]</span>
Letty known her aunt to be so gracious, so affectionate,
or in such talkative good-humour; she had
actually called her &#8216;darling!&#8217;</p>

<p>&#8220;I hope you are well wrapped up,&#8221; she urged;
&#8220;take care of your dress, darling.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;And mind <i>you</i> take great care of her,&#8221; supplemented
Blagdon at the carriage window. He held out
his hand to Letty, kept hers an unnecessary length of
time, and squeezed it painfully ere he closed the door
of the brougham and they drove off. The last object
she beheld, thrown into sharp relief by the glaring
lamps and red carpet, was his hard, staring brown
eyes, his stolid, complacent face, and she sank into her
corner with a sigh of relief. Thank goodness she would
never see him again!</p>

<p>She was to hear of him, however! On the way
home her aunt loudly sang the praises of Hugo Blagdon,
the richest man in the county. He had the most lovely
place, and was so popular; he had travelled a great
deal, and owned a yacht and a coach, indeed everything&mdash;just
like a prince in a fairy tale. During all
these eulogiums and dazzling descriptions Colonel
Fenchurch maintained an unusual silence.</p>

<p>&#8220;What do you think of him, Letty?&#8221; he enquired
at last.</p>

<p>&#8220;He dances well,&#8221; she answered carelessly, &#8220;though
he soon gets out of breath, and has rather an old-fashioned
step.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Well, there is not a woman in this part of the world
that isn&#8217;t delighted to have him for a partner,&#8221; said<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_52"></a>[52]</span>
her aunt, with an air of finality; then, changing the
subject, she proceeded to discuss the ball in detail,
from the decorations to the soup. Her remarks about
the guests&mdash;especially girls&mdash;were not altogether
generous; now that she had, so to speak, her own
goods to offer, Mrs. Fenchurch was a merciless critic
of the wares of others.</p>

<p>&#8220;Did you notice Lady Vera, Tom? She&#8217;s supposed
to be a beauty, a tall, scraggy, spotty creature, with
a wreath over her nose?&#8221; A pause. &#8220;And how <i>can</i>
Mrs. Reed allow her daughters to be seen in such filthy
frocks!&mdash;anything good enough for the country.
Those poor Bradfields hardly left their seats&mdash;<i>so</i>
humiliating for a chaperon to have her charges on
hand all the time&mdash;what do you say, Tom?&#8221;</p>

<p>But Tom&#8217;s sole reply was a gentle snore.</p>

<p>Then, turning to Letty and stroking her arm, her
aunt said:</p>

<p>&#8220;My dear child, you were perfectly right about the
white <i>cr&ecirc;pe</i>, you looked charming&mdash;charming! I was
proud of you!&#8221; and as she pinched her wrist, playfully,
the girl, with the quick insight of youth, divined
that here was an entirely different relative to the one
who had told her she was a &#8216;pauper, and a burden.&#8217;
She now addressed her, as if she were an equal&mdash;and
indeed there was actually a tinge of deference in her
remarks. What did it mean?</p>

<p>The Belle of the Hunt Ball toiled up to bed tired
and footsore at five o&#8217;clock in the morning. She had
enjoyed the evening immensely, and yet she had not<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_53"></a>[53]</span>
enjoyed it! On the one hand, there was the dancing,
the good partners, the charming things people had
said to her, and the agreeable inward conviction of
having been whispered about, and admired; on the
other, there was the rich man, with his staring eyes
and brusque, imperious manner&mdash;and the inexplicable
rise in the temperature of her aunt&#8217;s affection. What
did it mean?</p>

<p>And still wondering, Letty tumbled into bed, and
presently entered the land of dreams.</p>
<hr class="chap x-ebookmaker-drop" />

<div class="chapter">
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_54"></a>[54]</span>

<h2 class="nobreak">CHAPTER V</h2>
</div>


<p class="drop-cap">THE morning after the ball, Letty was aroused
from the profound sleep of youth and exhaustion
by a stealthy, grating sound, and opening her eyes, to
her amazement she beheld Jones, the under-housemaid,
kneeling on the hearth-rug, intent on kindling a
particularly sulky fire.</p>

<p>As she raised herself on her elbow, blinking and bewildered,
the maid sat up on her heels and proceeded
to explain the situation with glib volubility.</p>

<p>&#8220;Oh, miss, I&#8217;m sorry; the mistress gave orders you
were not to be disturbed, and I was to light your fire;
but there ain&#8217;t been one in the grate this forty year,
and it&#8217;s a sore job. Hawkins is bringing up your
breakfast.&#8221;</p>

<p>As she spoke, the door-handle turned and Hawkins
entered, bearing with unusual pomp and circumstance
a heavily laden tray. Letty rubbed her eyes. Was she
still dreaming? Why were the two maids in waiting
upon <i>her</i>? She was well aware that her aunt considered
bedroom fires unnecessary, and breakfast in bed a
slothful indulgence. She, however, dissembled her
surprise, and accepted these unexpected favours with
commendable composure.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_55"></a>[55]</span>Having nibbled at some buttered toast and swallowed
a cup of tea, she sprang out of bed to search for her
programme, and survey herself in the glass. In the glass
she beheld an oval face, a pair of drowsy blue eyes, a
pair of soft pink cheeks, and a mass of tumbled brown
hair. Was she beautiful? she wondered. Mr. Blagdon
had implied as much&mdash;indeed, more than implied.
What bad manners to make blunt personal remarks!
Well, <i>his</i> opinion was of no consequence; but did
other people think her pretty? (Other people naturally
included Lancelot Lumley. She confessed to
herself that she would like him to admire her.)</p>

<p>Oh, how cold it was! She curled up her delicate
little toes, and, programme in hand, plunged once
more into her comfortable nest. Here she prepared
to study at leisure the exciting contents of her precious
card&mdash;no easy task. The card was covered with
scribbled names, sketches, initials, stars, hieroglyphics,
corrections&mdash;and yet, on the whole, it made
agreeable reading.</p>

<p>In the midst of this interesting occupation the door
opened very gently&mdash;the programme disappeared as
if in the hands of a conjurer&mdash;and Mrs. Fenchurch
advanced into the room showing all her upper teeth,
a sure signal of unusual amiability.</p>

<p>&#8220;Well, my dear girl,&#8221; she began, &#8220;how are you to-day?
<i>Dead?</i>&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Oh no,&#8221; sitting erect; &#8220;I&#8217;m all right, thank you,
Aunt Dorothy.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I thought you&#8217;d better have a good sleep after<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_56"></a>[56]</span>
your first ball. My!&#8221; as her glance fell upon a tattered
garment, &#8220;look at your poor frock!&#8221;</p>

<p>Yes, indeed, there was a large obtrusive rent in the
skirt, and a streamer of ragged <i>cr&ecirc;pe</i> made no attempt
at concealment. Yet instead of the expected sharp
scolding, Mrs. Fenchurch merely remarked:</p>

<p>&#8220;<i>How</i> you danced! You could have filled your
card ten times over. By the way, may I look at your
programme? I see the blue tassel sticking out under
your pillow.&#8221;</p>

<p>With much reluctance, and deep and guilty blushes,
Letty produced the desired treasure and yielded it to
her visitor, who was now staring at her so fixedly, that
one would almost suppose that she beheld her for the
first time! In her mind&#8217;s eye, Mrs. Fenchurch really
was contemplating an absolutely strange niece! So
this simple, timid, obedient, little schoolgirl, unconsciously
possessed the fatal endowment, the wonderful,
invincible power, that has moved armies and fleets.
Unquestionably, Letty had the gift; and her relative
was determined to turn it to the utmost advantage.</p>

<p>With the record of her niece&#8217;s partners in her hand,
Mrs. Fenchurch seated herself, squarely, comfortably,
and sociably on the bed, and proceeded to discuss the
ball, and its incidents, with all the zest and vivacity of
one of the girl&#8217;s own contemporaries.</p>

<p>&#8220;How well I remember <i>my</i> first ball,&#8221; she said
meditatively; &#8220;I was so frightened my teeth actually
chattered as we drove to it, and, after all, I enjoyed
myself enormously. I wore white, of course, looped up<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_57"></a>[57]</span>
with water lilies, and I remember a spiteful cousin
asking me if they were not spinach and eggs! Girls
are so jealous! Now let me see who you danced with&mdash;um&mdash;um&mdash;um&mdash;&mdash;&#8221;
nodding her head as her eyes
travelled over the card. &#8220;Lord Deloraine twice&mdash;but,
of course, <i>he</i> is married&mdash;and what about the Duke?&#8221;
looking up quickly.</p>

<p>&#8220;I had not a dance left.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Who is V. K.? Oh yes, I know&mdash;the Austrian
Attach&eacute; staying with the Beauvoirs. H. B., H. B.,
H. B. Oh, <i>Letty</i>! How often did you dance with
Hugo Blagdon?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Two or three times,&#8221; she answered stiffly, having
made up her mind to give her aunt no satisfaction with
respect to this overbearing odious partner.</p>

<p>&#8220;He took you in to supper, dear, too,&#8221; continued
Mrs. Fenchurch; &#8220;and, oh yes,&#8221; nodding her head
and trying to look arch, &#8220;<i>I</i> saw you sitting together
in the long corridor. Tell me, what did you talk
about?&#8221; and she gazed into the girl&#8217;s face with a pair
of penetrating <i>asking</i> eyes.</p>

<p>How Letty wished she would not stare at her in
this fashion, and breathe through her nose. Positively
her aunt filled her with sheer physical terror&mdash;yes,
and repulsion.</p>

<p>&#8220;I really can&#8217;t remember, Aunt Dorothy. I think he
said the supper was bad.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;But surely he paid you some pretty compliment?&#8221;
persisted her tormentor. &#8220;Come now?&#8221; she urged
coaxingly.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_58"></a>[58]</span>&#8220;I daresay he did&mdash;I&mdash;I forget.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Did he say anything about coming over here to
call?&#8221; and her tone was anxious.</p>

<p>&#8220;I&mdash;I&#8217;m not sure,&#8221; murmured the girl, who mentally
writhed under this inquisition. Never in her life had
she felt so mortally shamefaced and shrinking. She
longed to pull the bedclothes over her head and
hide herself away, from that inflexibly soliciting
countenance.</p>

<p>Her reluctant replies were so vague and unsatisfactory,
that at last her chaperon realised she could
not get much out of Letty as yet&mdash;all in good time!
Again she gazed at her niece long and thoughtfully, as
though seeing in her a multitude of new possibilities;
then, rising, she said in her brisk, every-day manner:</p>

<p>&#8220;I&#8217;ll tell Jones to bring up your bath water&mdash;it
is nearly twelve o&#8217;clock,&#8221; and Mrs. Fen took her
departure, leaving the girl with a grateful sense of
pressure removed, and a happy consciousness of relief.</p>

<p>When, an hour later, the beauty of the Hunt Ball
descended to the morning-room, she found herself still
surrounded by an atmosphere of indulgence and affection.
Her aunt handed her a novel to read; as a rule
light literature was tabooed till nightfall&mdash;and at
lunch Mrs. Fen helped her poor relation to the liver
wing, and commanded Hawkins to give Miss Glyn a
glass of claret.</p>

<p>When Hawkins had withdrawn, after serving the
coffee, Mrs. Fenchurch cleared her throat and said:</p>

<p>&#8220;The Bonhams are having a young people&#8217;s dance<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_59"></a>[59]</span>
this day week, and Lady Bonham has asked me to go
over and take you, Letty, and stay all night. How
would you like that?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;It would be delightful&mdash;another dance!&#8221; and her
eyes sparkled.</p>

<p>&#8220;I&#8217;ve been talking to Fletcher this morning, and she
thinks that if I have Mrs. Cope up from the village she
may be able to make the white brocade and the green
cloth. I daresay you won&#8217;t mind giving a little assistance
yourself?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;No, indeed, Aunt Dorothy. I shall be delighted.
I&#8217;m rather good at sewing.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Oh, here comes Cousin Maude.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Well, Letty, here I am,&#8221; said Mrs. Hesketh, as she
entered. &#8220;I&#8217;ve come to hear about the ball, how
everyone looked and behaved, what they wore, who
sat out as wallflowers, or otherwise? and I particularly
wish to see your programme. I haven&#8217;t had one in
my hand for ten years. Where is it?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;How tiresome,&#8221; thought the girl; one would
suppose that her wretched little card, was something
remarkable.</p>

<p>The programme happened to be at the top of the
house, and when Letty returned with it in her hand
she found her aunt talking to Cousin Maude with unusual
<i>empressement</i>. She was sitting close beside her
on the sofa, pouring some important statement into
her ear.</p>

<p>Whatever she was saying was interrupted by the
entrance of her niece, who caught the words:</p>



<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_60"></a>[60]</span>&#8220;Eyes for no one else!&#8221; Mrs. Fenchurch paused and
nodded significantly at her companion, as much as to
say:</p>

<p>&#8220;Of this&mdash;more later.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;And so I hear your dress looked lovely, Letty, and
that you had a great success. Now hand me over
that programme,&#8221; said Mrs. Hesketh with a smile.
&#8220;Ah, yes, I see every dance, and all manner of strange
autographs and initials. I declare you ought to have
this photographed! And so you enjoyed yourself very
much, dear child?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Oh, immensely,&#8221; she answered, with a happy sigh;
the little drawbacks were now fading, the strains of a
delicious waltz were ringing in her ears, and she was
floating round the room in the arms of Lancelot
Lumley.</p>

<p>&#8220;And you are going to a dinner and dance this day
week&mdash;why, you are getting quite gay!&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Well, you see, Cousin Maude, I am &#8216;out&#8217; now.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Yes, you have stretched your little wings and
flown beyond the village into what is called the world.
I wonder how you will like it?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Very much, I think, as far as I have seen.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;And that amounts to one ball. What experience!&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Letty has not seen much,&#8221; admitted Mrs. Fenchurch;
&#8220;but our little world has now seen <i>her</i>,&#8221; and
she smiled complacently. &#8220;Ah, there is Wilson, of
course, somebody wants me. Oh, I really never have
five minutes to myself. I expect it is about the<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_61"></a>[61]</span>
carpenter. Don&#8217;t go away before I come back,
Maudie,&#8221; and she bustled out of the room.</p>

<p>&#8220;Now, my dear child,&#8221; said Mrs. Hesketh, dragging
her down beside her on the sofa, &#8220;tell me really and
truly, all about last evening. Was it as nice as you
expected?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Yes&mdash;every bit.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;And which of your partners did you like the best?
Come, honour bright.&#8221;</p>

<p>Letty reflected for a moment.</p>

<p>&#8220;As far as dancing went, there was an Austrian
Attach&eacute; who danced like a dream&mdash;but, of course, I
knew Mr. Lumley before.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;And what of Mr. Blagdon?&#8221; enquired her friend
with a searching look.</p>

<p>&#8220;Oh, he was rather heavy, and easily tired and out
of breath&mdash;of course, he is old.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Old! Why, I don&#8217;t believe he is a day more than
six or seven and thirty, the prime of life! Apparently
Lancelot Lumley and Mr. Blagdon were your two
most favoured partners&mdash;but, my dear girl, I cannot
allow you to have anything to say to either of
them.&#8221;</p>

<p>Letty burst into a ringing laugh: her laugh was
spontaneous and delightful.</p>

<p>&#8220;Why not?&#8221; she demanded.</p>

<p>&#8220;One is too poor, and the other is too rich.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;But, Cousin Maudie, surely one doesn&#8217;t think of
such things as future husbands&mdash;just at a dance?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Oh, well, I don&#8217;t suppose that <i>you</i> do,&#8221; and<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_62"></a>[62]</span>
she turned away and stared into the fire. For
several minutes she did not speak, then at last she
said:</p>

<p>&#8220;You must promise never to take a fancy to anybody
without giving me due notice, and the next time
you go to a dance you are to leave your heart with me.
You shall have it back with interest.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I don&#8217;t think I have that kind of heart. I&#8217;m
afraid my heart is hard; I don&#8217;t care for many
people; but I am very very fond of uncle and of
you&mdash;and of Sam.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;And where does your aunt come in?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Well, you see, Aunt Dorothy is not&mdash;er&mdash;my own
aunt. I don&#8217;t fancy that she has much sympathy with
girls&mdash;her mind is taken up with other things.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Yes, she is a born administrator and manager;
not merely of her own affairs; she has a wide
horizon. I believe one of her ancestors must have
been a Prime Minister. Doodie is ready to take a
hand in anyone&#8217;s life, and at a moment&#8217;s notice.
Supposing a stranger were to fall ill in the village,
she would come forward at once, find them a nurse
and doctor; if they died, wire to their friends, arrange
for the funeral, buy the grave, and see that they
were laid in it! In your case, she is not contemplating
a funeral&mdash;but a wedding!&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I&mdash;I&mdash;don&#8217;t understand,&#8221; stammered the girl.</p>

<p>&#8220;Don&#8217;t you, my simple darling? Well, there is one
fact that you may possibly grasp&mdash;your aunt is monstrously
proud of you; the Chippendale sideboard, and<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_63"></a>[63]</span>
the three-year-old thoroughbred are for the present
languishing in the cold shade. Ah, here she comes!&#8221;</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>The white brocade (trimmed with lace instead of the
despised green ribbon) was completed in good time,
and Letty and her aunt, with their luggage on the carriage,
drove off to Bonham Court in high spirits. It
was a large, rambling old place, occupied by a childless
couple who had a passion for the society of young
people. First of all, there was a merry gathering at
tea in the big hall. Here Mrs. Fenchurch was agreeably
surprised to recognise Mr. Blagdon, who welcomed her
and her niece with flattering cordiality.</p>

<p>At dinner pretty Miss Glyn was his <i>vis-&agrave;-vis</i>; she
was placed between two boys&mdash;an Etonian and a
young fellow lately gazetted to the Guards&mdash;and they
appeared to be enjoying themselves immensely. He
had every opportunity of studying her at his leisure,
ignoring his partner&mdash;who noticed, with smouldering
resentment, that his whole attention was devoted to
the little girl opposite&mdash;a Miss Glyn that everyone was
talking about. She certainly had a wonderful complexion&mdash;if
it was her own!&mdash;and a profile, clear cut
as a cameo&mdash;yes&mdash;and youth! The neglected lady
asked herself if it could be possible, that this hopelessly
dull <i>parti</i>, who sat beside her drinking glass
after glass of champagne, was thinking seriously of
that simple and innocent child?</p>

<p>After dinner there was dancing in the great hall.<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_64"></a>[64]</span>
Mr. Blagdon danced several times with Letty, and she
found him less formidable than on the former occasion,
not so grand, detached, or condescending. She liked
him better, or to put it more correctly, disliked him
less. He now talked as an ordinary partner, and not
as a far-removed magnificent potentate; spoke of his
dogs and horses and gardens, and hoped that she
might one day see them!</p>

<p>Subsequently he made himself conspicuously attentive
to Mrs. Fenchurch, sat out with her, and engaged
her in a long conversation in the drawing-room, promenaded
by her side in the picture gallery, and finally
conducted her to supper. This, to the experienced,
was a registered symptom that the great Blagdon
had intentions respecting the lady&#8217;s niece! and the
same happy matron, as she sat beside him at
table, had much ado to quench the exultation in
her face.</p>

<p>The following afternoon the party broke up, and the
gay and cheery company that sped Letty and her
aunt, little guessed how the girl shrank from the impending
and enforced <i>t&ecirc;te-&agrave;-t&ecirc;te</i> in the family brougham.
She dreaded the ordeal as if she were about to undergo
some painful physical operation; with all her muscles
tense, and leaning far back in her corner, she submitted,
whilst her companion, in her most insinuating voice,
so to speak, put the question or questions, in return
receiving, it must be confessed, very brief, and crooked
answers.</p>

<p>The hall door stood wide as they drove up to The<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_65"></a>[65]</span>
Holt. Standing on the steps in the full light, Colonel
Fenchurch shouted a hearty welcome.</p>

<p>He backed into the hall in front of the arrivals,
talking all the time.</p>

<p>&#8220;Missed you both desperately&mdash;no piquet&mdash;no
music&mdash;ready to hang myself last night. I say, I&#8217;ve
kept the toast and scones warm inside the fender&mdash;tea
will be ready in a jiff. Lots of letters for you,
Doodie.&#8221;</p>

<p>As they entered the warm, well-lighted drawing-room,
he turned about to face the ladies, and noticed
that his little girl looked brilliantly pretty, as she laid
her cold cheek against his, and said:</p>

<p>&#8220;Such a delightful party, Uncle Tom, and one of
the Barrons&mdash;Sophy&mdash;was at my school.&#8221;</p>

<p>Yes, he said to himself, it was nice for the child
to mix with young people of her own age&mdash;it did
her good.</p>

<p>When tea was over and uncle and niece found themselves
alone, she came and sat on the arm of his chair,
and rattled off an amusing description of her visit, and
repeated for his entertainment many of the jokes and
anecdotes that had been bandied about among the
company: enumerated the names of the guests, and
even of the Bonham house dogs, but made no mention
whatever of the great Hugo Blagdon.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>Mrs. Fenchurch felt unusually elated: being firmly
persuaded that she was about to have the glory and<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_66"></a>[66]</span>
gratification of setting in motion a triumphal drama
of real life; and the morning after her return she
sought her husband in the smoking-room, generously
resolved, that he, too, should have a share in her
glorious expectations.</p>

<p>Having carefully closed the door, she came and
stood by the fire, and said in a low and almost
awestruck voice:</p>

<p>&#8220;<i>Hugo Blagdon was there, Tom.</i> I was so surprised!&#8221;</p>

<p>Her husband put down his pipe, and stared at her
stupidly.</p>

<p>&#8220;Why, what is surprising about him?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Oh, nothing, except that he is immensely struck
with Letty; he as much as told me so.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Did he, indeed!&#8221; sitting erect. &#8220;I don&#8217;t think
my little Letty would suit him at all.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;You will allow, Tom, that he knows best; a man
of his age has some idea of the sort of girl he admires
by this time!&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Humph!&#8221; he grunted, &#8220;I have never known him
admire a <i>girl</i> yet&mdash;it&#8217;s always been the married women
he runs after.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;That run after him, you mean,&#8221; she corrected.
&#8220;Well, I think he has made up his mind to settle at
last.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I hope to goodness he hasn&#8217;t made up his mind to
settle on my niece. For one thing, he is twenty years
older than she is&mdash;if not more&mdash;a blas&eacute; fellow who has
knocked about the world and been his own master (and,<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_67"></a>[67]</span>
by all accounts, a bad one) since he was sixteen. Why
the stories about him and Mrs. Corbett&mdash;scandalous
stories&mdash;are common property.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;He is a very good sort&mdash;if no saint,&#8221; declared his
wife. &#8220;I know you have a prejudice against him&mdash;because
the Lumleys don&#8217;t like him, and you like
the Lumleys; but you cannot deny that he is
popular?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;A man with forty thousand a year is bound to be
that,&#8221; growled her husband.</p>

<p>&#8220;He is extremely liberal, and subscribes to everything,&#8221;
continued Mrs. Fenchurch. &#8220;I believe Letty
would be the most fortunate girl in England, if she was
Mrs. Blagdon. He is certainly thinking of marrying&mdash;for
the place is entailed, and if anything were to happen
to him, every acre of the property would go to a
cousin in New Zealand, whom he loathes.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;And you think he is going to take a wife, if it is
only to spite his cousin, eh, Doodie?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I think, my dear Tom, that you are in one of your
funny tempers this morning&mdash;you smoke too much, or
you have got a chill on your liver,&#8221; and she patted him
lightly on the head. &#8220;Why, you ought to be enchanted
at your niece&#8217;s prospects! She is just the sort of little
thing that will take to wealth and luxury, like a duck
to water.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Since you go to the poultry-yard for your similes,
it&#8217;s my opinion, that you are counting your chickens
before they are hatched. What has put this ridiculous
idea into your head? Has he <i>said</i> anything?&#8221;</p>



<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_68"></a>[68]</span>&#8220;No&mdash;not in so many words&mdash;but he is coming over
here to lunch on Friday.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;To lunch&mdash;&mdash;for what?&#8221; he demanded, and his
tone was sharp and inhospitable.</p>

<p>&#8220;He says,&#8221; she hesitated for a moment, &#8220;he says,
he has heard a great deal of our&mdash;chrysanthemums.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Twenty miles&#8217; drive to look at half a dozen pots
of chrysanthemums! <i>Bah!</i>&#8221; and Colonel Fenchurch
sprang to his feet, snatched up his cap, and went out
of the room.</p>
<hr class="chap x-ebookmaker-drop" />

<div class="chapter">
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_69"></a>[69]</span>

<h2 class="nobreak">CHAPTER VI</h2>
</div>


<p class="drop-cap">FOR one whole week the post-bag carried to Mrs.
Fen a sharp disappointment, instead of an expected
letter. In the course of certain promenades
and <i>t&ecirc;te-&agrave;-t&ecirc;tes</i> at Bonham Court, Blagdon had accepted
the lady&#8217;s warm invitation to come and see them, and
promised to fix his own day; indeed the last words he
uttered, as he pressed her hand in a significant farewell,
were:</p>

<p>&#8220;<i>I will write.</i>&#8221;</p>

<p>This encouraging pledge had maintained certain
buoyant hopes, but now these hopes began to sink,
and fears to rise.</p>

<p>By most exasperating ill-luck, Mrs. Fenchurch was
engaged to attend a function in London&mdash;the wedding
of a niece, who was making a marriage that reflected
credit on the whole connection. She had forwarded a
handsome gift (one of her bargains), and angled for an
invitation to spend a week with a relative in Portland
Place, in order, she declared, &#8220;to help dearest sister
Cecilia and see the whole &#8216;thing through.&#8217;&#8221;</p>

<p>Carefully matured plans, laid weeks ahead, were on
this occasion too previous; but how was the unhappy
woman to know that by her absence from home at the
critical moment, she was risking the prospects of an<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_70"></a>[70]</span>
alliance that would throw Cecilia&#8217;s paltry triumph into
the cold, cold shade. The baffled chaperon looked
worn and worried; her condition communicated itself
to others. She complained of neuralgia&mdash;Mrs. Fenchurch&#8217;s
neuralgia was an ailment to be feared&mdash;these
were uncomfortable days for her household: everything
seemed to go wrong: servants, dogs, appointments,
and clocks.</p>

<p>But in her aunt&#8217;s anxieties respecting Hugo Blagdon,
Miss Glyn had no share; indeed, she scarcely cast a
thought to that important personage. On the other
hand, it must be frankly admitted that her mind was
too frequently occupied by Lancelot Lumley.</p>

<p>Although the school at Dresden was notably strict
<i>et bien surveill&eacute;</i>, nevertheless the Teuton atmosphere
breathes romance and sentiment, and a certain amount
of this had penetrated through the secluded walls of
Madam Franck&#8217;s establishment; girls whispered to
one another of love&#8217;s young dream, yes, and of&mdash;lovers.
Also, in the vacation spent in Dresden, Letty had read
not a few selected novels, including those by Sir Walter
Scott, Mrs. Gaskell, and Miss Young. As for her
favourite heroes, she was divided between Sir Guy
Morville and Wilfred of Ivanhoe. Since she had made
Mr. Lumley&#8217;s acquaintance, Wilfred the Palmer bore
away the palm. The fresh imagination of Sweet Seventeen
discovered a remarkable resemblance between the
twelfth-century crusader, and the smart young officer
of the present day&mdash;both had grey eyes, and crisp
light hair, both were soldiers and bold horsemen. Besides<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_71"></a>[71]</span>
certain attributes shared with the disinherited
knight, Lancelot Lumley danced admirably, had an
infectious laugh, and a delightful personality, that set
one immediately at ease.</p>

<p>As she compared his light, active figure and clean-cut,
tanned face, to her aunt&#8217;s beau-ideal, Mr. Blagdon,
with his ponderous form, brick-coloured countenance,
and heavily scented person, the young lady threw up
her chin with a gesture of scornful disparagement.
She recalled Lumley&#8217;s glance of profound interest and
respectful homage, and then thought, with a shudder,
of Blagdon&#8217;s insatiable black eyes&mdash;these looked as if
their owner, like some fabled monster, was prepared
to devour her alive! Miss Glyn had only met Mr.
Lumley on five occasions, and yet she remembered
almost every sentence they had exchanged&mdash;especially
what <i>he</i> had said&mdash;oh fatal, fatal symptom in the case
of a maiden, who has never yet encountered an object
on which to lavish the overflowing tenderness of a
warm and innocent heart. Secretly, she looked forward
to their next meeting; she liked to hear of him
(already &#8216;Him&#8217; with a capital). His name casually
mentioned, caused her pulse to flutter and her colour
to rise. At the Rectory, she listened thirstily to tales
of Lance&#8217;s boyish scrapes, and Lance&#8217;s successes;
anecdotes of his generosity, unselfishness, and courage,
were poured into the girl&#8217;s enchanted ears&mdash;for next
to Mabel the boy was a favourite topic,&mdash;and to talk
long and copiously to a sympathetic companion, was
one of the invalid&#8217;s few remaining pleasures. Meanwhile,<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_72"></a>[72]</span>
the girl mended lace, or made neat covers for
books in the parish library, and absorbed many intoxicating
impressions.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>By a curious coincidence, the day and hour of
Mr. Lumley&#8217;s arrival and Mrs. Fen&#8217;s departure were
simultaneous; indeed, they actually met on the little
platform at Tatton, the lady, encumbered with a
goodly quantity of luggage, queer-shaped domestic
parcels, and even returned empties. All these were,
however, the care of Tom, and she hurried off to take
her ticket; as she turned away from the window she
was accosted by, of all people, young Lumley! How
good-looking he was, she noted fretfully, and what on
earth was bringing him to Thornby again? Could it
be Letty? She must have a word with Tom at once;
he was on no account to invite Lancelot to The Holt,
not on any pretext whatever. Meanwhile, she extended
a stiff hand, and said:</p>

<p>&#8220;What, back already! How do you manage to get
all this leave? It looks as if they were able to <i>spare</i>
you!&#8221; and she smiled disagreeably.</p>

<p>What the deuce was the matter with Mrs. Fen?
Lumley wondered; and they had always been such
pals&mdash;why had she her knife into him? (Mrs. Fen
confessed to a weakness for young men, and even
allowed herself to be chaffed about &#8216;her boys.&#8217; She
liked them to hail her at Meets, jog beside her from
cover to cover, could make herself agreeable at a ball<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_73"></a>[73]</span>
supper, and had been known to sit out. Young fellows
looked on Mrs. &#8220;Fen&#8221; as a good sporting sort, with
no nonsense about her, she had even been consulted
on delicate affairs; and more than once, her unsuspected
finger had been busy in other people&#8217;s pies!)</p>

<p>&#8220;I&#8217;ve only got a few days,&#8221; he began. &#8220;Hullo,
here&#8217;s your train! Why, it&#8217;s gone mad, it&#8217;s punctual!
I&#8217;ll look after you all right&mdash;let me have your dressing-case
and traps. Come on,&#8221; and before the unfortunate
lady could protest he had seized upon her bag and was
running along the platform.</p>

<p>&#8220;Where&#8217;s Tom?&#8221; she screamed as she hurried in
his wake. &#8220;I particularly want to speak to him&mdash;I
<i>must</i> see him. There he is on the bridge talking to
Major Bassett! Oh, he is <i>never</i> in the way, when
he is wanted.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Here you are,&#8221; cried Lumley, wrenching open a
door, and bundling her wraps and parcels into an empty
carriage. &#8220;Got it all to yourself. Great luck!&#8221;</p>

<p>He was really <i>too</i> officious: Mrs. Fen&#8217;s sharp eye
had detected the Countess of Hopeland in another
compartment, and they could have travelled up together
so sociably and comfortably.</p>

<p>&#8220;Hurry up! Hurry up!&#8221; shouted the guard
sharply: the traffic at Tatton, was insignificant, no
need to delay.</p>

<p>&#8220;I see you have a foot-warmer,&#8221; said the irrepressible
Lumley. &#8220;Can I get you anything?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;If you could get hold of Tom,&#8221; standing up as
she spoke; &#8220;it&#8217;s most important!&#8221;</p>



<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_74"></a>[74]</span>Tom by this time was approaching at the double,
but the train was moving too.</p>

<p>&#8220;I say, can&#8217;t I give him your message?&#8221; asked
Lumley as he kept pace beside the carriage door.</p>

<p>&#8220;No, no, no!&#8221; snapped the lady with irritable impatience,
and it seemed to the good-natured and bewildered
young man, that the last look he received
from Mrs. Fen, had been positively malignant and
menacing!</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>Colonel Fenchurch was delighted to meet Lancelot
Lumley, whom he had known from boyhood and helped
into his own corps. He gave him a lift to Thornby,
enjoying <i>en route</i> a full budget of regimental news;
and when he deposited his passenger and portmanteau
at the Rectory, invited him to The Holt
that same evening to take pot luck.</p>

<p>It was a memorable occasion. Miss Glyn in white and
blushes, occupied her aunt&#8217;s place&mdash;a lovely <i>vice-reine</i>.
The menu was excellent&mdash;Letty had taken particular
pains with the flowers, and candle-shades, as well as
her own toilet,&mdash;though her fingers shook unaccountably
as she did her hair, and endeavoured to fasten
maddening hooks,&mdash;that attached themselves to everything
but their corresponding eyes, as if they were
alive and possessed! However, the result of the toilet
was all that could be desired, and the timid hostess
descended to the drawing-room. With the first laugh
her tremors vanished, and somehow the absence of the<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_75"></a>[75]</span>
Lady of The Holt, contributed to the ease and gaiety
of the little gathering. Conversation flowed uninterruptedly,
laughter was frequent and hearty, and
the rose-shaded candles illuminated a thoroughly
congenial trio. The Colonel related old stories,&mdash;now
undismayed by his Dorothy&#8217;s frowns,&mdash;and drank
two glasses of port; the pug was made happy with
a bone, Letty put her elbows on the table and
chattered like a schoolgirl, remained whilst the
men smoked, and subsequently in the drawing-room
delighted them with her songs. Lancelot Lumley
hung over the piano (and the Colonel dozed by the
fire, with Sammy the pug, also dozing, on his knee)
absorbing music and love&mdash;it was without exception
the most glorious evening he had ever spent!</p>

<p>Before the guest took his departure, various agreeable
plans were laid for future meetings.</p>

<p>&#8220;Mind, you must drop in whenever you like, Lance,&#8221;
said his host as he accompanied him to the hall door.
&#8220;You know your way here&mdash;come up to lunch to-morrow
at one sharp, and we will all go skating on
Barnby Mere. I hear the ice is first-rate.&#8221;</p>

<p>The next afternoon&#8217;s post brought the Colonel a
letter from his wife; it was short, urgent, and very
much to the point. When he had read it, he tore it up
thoughtfully and placed it in the fire; only to Mrs.
Hesketh, when she dropped in to tea, did he divulge
the contents. In reply to her question, &#8220;Heard from
Doodie?&#8221; he answered:</p>

<p>&#8220;No&mdash;er&mdash;yes&mdash;just a line&mdash;I say, Maudie, it&#8217;s a<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_76"></a>[76]</span>
bit awkward&mdash;she bars young Lumley, and I&#8217;ve been
asking him to look in whenever he pleases. Now I&#8217;m
not to let him put his nose inside the door!&#8221;</p>

<p>In reply to the lady&#8217;s elevated brows, he added:</p>

<p>&#8220;The fact of the matter is, Doodie&#8217;s afraid the boy
might take a fancy to Letty.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;And, of course, no subalterns need apply! I see;
well, I believe that you are locking the door, when
the steed is stolen.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;What, you don&#8217;t mean that&mdash;it&#8217;s one of your
jokes?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;No, indeed, I&#8217;m in deadly earnest; but you must
do as Doodie wishes.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;He&#8217;s a nice young fellow, as keen as mustard,
and straight as a die; and I&#8217;m fond of Lance.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;So am I,&#8221; assented Mrs. Hesketh. &#8220;Wouldn&#8217;t
they make an ideal couple!&mdash;so young and honest, and
good-looking&mdash;but naturally we must not think of it.
Where are they now? Together?&#8221; and she glanced
at her companion with whimsical dismay.</p>

<p>&#8220;Yes, they went off to the skating after lunch. I
intended going too, but I&#8217;ve a touch of gout.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;What, all the way to Barnby Mere&mdash;<i>alone</i>? If
Doodie knew, she&#8217;d have fit after fit.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;No, no; I believe they were to call for Denton.
But I say, Maudie, I&#8217;m rather in a hole, I&#8217;ve asked the
fellow to shoot to-morrow, and to dine.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I&#8217;ll take him off your hands for dinner,&#8221; she
answered with short decision, &#8220;the shoot can stand
over. We must manage somehow.&#8221;</p>



<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_77"></a>[77]</span>As Mrs. Hesketh walked through the village in
the frosty January night, she heard two voices approaching;
and presently Letty and her escort came
into view.&mdash;They had deposited the Rector at home,
and were <i>en route</i> to The Holt, unaware that its door
was now, figuratively, barred against this undesirable
Guest.</p>

<p>Moved by a sudden impulse, she resolved that her
own house should stand wide for him, and for Letty.
Yes, in spite of Doodie and Prudence! These two
young people should have just <i>one</i> glimpse of Paradise,
before the dust and tumult of the world overtook them.</p>

<p>Maude Hesketh was a clever woman, and it was marvellous
how she contrived to arrange meetings without
apparent effort, or giving cause for remark, much less
gossip. She had a taste for psychology, for the study
of character, and a charming romance unfolded under
her own eyes was ten times more absorbing than any
novel. She watched the swift and silent approaches
of spirit to spirit, listened to the light raillery and
random talk, that disguised much greater things,&mdash;which
so far remained unspoken. Letty and Lancelot
were unaware, that they were in the thrall of the all-compelling
power, which insensibly draws youth to
youth. But their hostess noted their happy faces, their
tireless sociability, their frequent, and uncalled-for
smiles.</p>

<p>To do Mrs. Hesketh justice, her friends were not altogether
the mere victims of a cynical interest; in the
core of a withered heart, long-forgotten emotions and<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_78"></a>[78]</span>
sympathies, were stirring. In the days of her exquisite
youth, Maude Charlton, too, had a gallant, handsome,
penniless lover; but when love had extended imploring
arms she suffered ambition to restrain her, and
accepted instead of a heart&#8217;s devotion, middle age,
position, and wealth. He, the abandoned, had gone
to India and there shortly afterwards died. Often now,
in the barren autumn of her life, did her thoughts
turn to Lawrence Ormond&mdash;her heart ached and
ached, as she thought with wet eyes, of his neglected
grave in some sun-scorched up-country cemetery.
Thirty years had elapsed since three volleys had been
fired over that shrunken mound, and he was now forgotten
by all. Mrs. Hesketh had a habit of whispering
to herself, scraps of poetry, lines that she admired, and
that dwelt in her memory, and as she recalled her
young dead lover, she would murmur the appropriate
quotation:</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
<div class="first">&#8220;Forget not Earth thy disappointed ones,</div>
<div class="verse">Forget not the forgotten.&#8221;</div>
</div></div>

<p>Then would brush away a tear that trickled down her
cheek, and exclaim:</p>

<p>&#8220;You silly old woman; your mind is wandering&mdash;don&#8217;t
drivel!&#8221;</p>

<p>Nevertheless, the spell of the past held her; and her
cynicism was but skin deep. As an officer&#8217;s wife,
knocking about the world with Lawrence, fighting its
battles by his side, making the best of things, and
seeing life in its wider aspect, she might have been a<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_79"></a>[79]</span>
happy woman&mdash;and he still living. She had seen a
letter from an army surgeon, in which the writer declared
that Ormond had a splendid constitution, but
made no fight. He seemed to have lost all interest in
life, and to be glad to go out of it, and therefore fell an
easy prey to the pestilence that walketh in darkness,
and whose name is Cholera.</p>

<p>As Maude Hesketh crouched over her fire, dreaming
of her youth, she asked herself why should not Lance
and Letty benefit by <i>her</i> experience, and have their
chance? This girl had no ambition, no extravagant
tastes. Lancelot was clever and steady, and by all
accounts bound to get on. If he only had his company,
once in India, with a little help they could
manage to scrape along. She would contribute a
canteen of plate, all the house-linen, and a cheque.</p>

<p>And what about Doodie Fenchurch? demanded a
sharp, inward voice, Doodie, whose head was filled
with dazzling plans. Was she strong enough to withstand
her masterful cousin and uphold the girl for
the sake of sentimental memories and the ashes of
her own long-dead romance? Alas! to this question,
her mental reply was a prompt and unqualified &#8216;No.&#8217;</p>

<p>Her conscience now took Maude Hesketh in hand.
She had indulged herself unwarrantably, she had enjoyed
bringing the two children together in order to
contemplate their happiness for her own gratification,
and <i>they</i> would ultimately be called upon to pay for her
entertainment&mdash;because she was a coward.</p>

<p>The few days&#8217; leave had gone like a flash, and the<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_80"></a>[80]</span>
end of the week found Mrs. Fenchurch at home, where,
to borrow a military expression, &#8216;all were present and
correct,&#8217; although Tom was a little gouty and Letty
looked pale&mdash;she must get her a tonic. Young Lumley
had departed, Mr. Blagdon had not yet appeared&mdash;so
far the coast was clear, and all was well!</p>

<p>Perhaps if Mrs. Fen had been behind the scenes she
might have modified her opinion; but she did not
know of those delightful skating parties on Barnby
Mere. Letty and Lancelot skated admirably, better
than any other couple; and skimmed round together at
a racing pace, with the frosty air stinging their faces,
the bright red sunset giving a colour to the cold, wintry
scene. How was she to know of that evening at
Oldcourt, when Letty sang Tosti&#8217;s &#8220;Good-bye,&#8221; with
thrilling pathos, and Lumley, sitting in the shadow,
had listened with folded arms, and a face of rigid
pallor? How could she dream of their last walk with
the Rector and Mrs. Hesketh, when they two lagged
behind, at the crooked bridge in order to watch the
gorgeous sunset, and Lumley said in a strange, husky
voice:</p>

<p>&#8220;I&#8217;m off to-night&mdash;God knows when we shall meet
again&mdash;but you know, Letty; you <i>know</i>&mdash;&mdash;&#8221;</p>

<p>Letty&#8217;s heart leaped at the sound of her Christian
name. She looked away, fixing her gaze on a great
clump of snow-bound rushes, and awaited the end of
the sentence with a thumping pulse. He was about to
tell her what she longed to hear; but Lumley hesitated
and controlled himself,&mdash;biting back words that<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_81"></a>[81]</span>
crowded to his lips. He had all but succumbed to a
fierce temptation to assure this little girl that he adored
her.</p>

<p>Then came the voice of the Rector through the thin,
frosty air, calling in a high, clerical monotone:</p>

<p>&#8220;Come on, come on, Lance; you have no time to
spare! come on&mdash;come on.&#8221;</p>

<p>And they turned to obey this summons without a
second&#8217;s hesitation, for though no word&mdash;no word of
love&mdash;was uttered, the silence had spoken; the long
self-conscious silence between these two young people&mdash;and
silence can be eloquent!</p>

<h2 class="nobreak">CHAPTER VII</h2>
</div>


<p class="drop-cap">THE afternoon after her return from London,
energetic Mrs. Fen, descended on the Rectory,
in order, she declared, &#8220;to tell poor dear Amy Denton
all her news,&#8221; but in reality to establish a plain understanding
with respect to young Lumley. If he were
to be continually running to and fro and hanging about
Thornby, he might put foolish ideas into Letty&#8217;s silly
little head. She therefore determined to take time by
the forelock, and oust him, not merely from her own
abode, but also from the village!</p>

<p>Pale Mrs. Denton, blissfully unconscious of her errand,
welcomed her neighbour with her usual sunny smiles.</p>

<p>After a gorgeous description of the trousseau, presents,
the wedding gown, and the wedding guests, Mrs.
Fen suddenly paused, and taking, so to speak, a long
breath, resumed in her most trenchant and impressive
manner:</p>

<p>&#8220;And now, dearest Amy, I have something very
important to say to you; it&#8217;s about your nephew&mdash;and
my niece.&#8221;</p>

<p>As a rule, Letty was &#8216;my husband&#8217;s niece,&#8217; but now
Mrs. Fen saw the bright day approaching when she
could claim her not only as niece, but adopted
daughter!</p>



<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_83"></a>[83]</span>&#8220;You mean Lancelot and Letty?&#8221; said Mrs.
Denton in a constrained voice.</p>

<p>&#8220;Yes; a stitch in time saves nine, and I want you,
dearest Amy, to grant me a favour, and not invite
Lancelot here for some months. When idle young
people are together, they have little to do but flirt,
imagine themselves in love, and get into mischief.
They are so tiresome, and often bring no end of misery
on themselves and others.&#8221;</p>

<p>She paused for a moment, but Mrs. Denton merely
nodded her head in feeble assent.</p>

<p>&#8220;You see,&#8221; pursued the visitor, &#8220;Letty is quite
remarkable in the way of good looks&mdash;her face is, and
must be, her fortune. We hope she may make a suitable
match&mdash;in fact, to you, Amy, I know I may say
in confidence, that one is already on the <i>tapis</i>.&#8221;</p>

<p>(Recently the frost had driven Blagdon to London;
he had met Mrs. Fenchurch in Piccadilly and spoken
to her for a moment&mdash;but in that moment he enquired
for her niece.)</p>

<p>&#8220;As for Lancelot, he is on the threshold of what will,
no doubt, be a brilliant career. By all accounts he is
so clever, and well thought of in his profession. To hurl
himself into matrimony and misery&mdash;for marriage without
money is misery&mdash;to hamper himself with a wife&mdash;and
family&mdash;would&mdash;&mdash;&#8221; and her tone became solemnly
prophetic&mdash;&#8220;be his <i>ruin</i>!&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Yes, I suppose so,&#8221; meekly assented his aunt.</p>

<p>&#8220;You may be sure of it, Amy,&#8221; urged her friend
forcibly. &#8220;You and I must be wise for these young<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_84"></a>[84]</span>
people, and before matters take any form, let us keep
them apart, for Lancelot&#8217;s sake. I know I can rely on
<i>your</i> assistance. They are so ridiculously young&mdash;barely
forty years between them.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;That&#8217;s true, they are young,&#8221; admitted the invalid.
&#8220;Too young, but surely they could wait? I
know that the boy is the soul of honour, and nothing
has been <i>said</i>.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I should hope not!&#8221; interrupted the ruler of
Thornby, and her voice was sharp.</p>

<p>&#8220;But I believe he is deeply in love, that he almost
worships Letty. Such an attachment keeps a young
man so straight, and gives him a wonderful incentive
to strive for success. Lancelot has done splendidly so
far; he is well thought of in his regiment, he is studying
hard, getting up Hindustani and Pushtoo&mdash;&mdash;&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Hindustani&mdash;Pushtoo!&#8221; broke in Mrs. Fenchurch
impatiently, &#8220;he may get up what he likes, but he will
never get my niece. She is the last sort of girl to follow
the baggage wagon! Now,&#8221; laying a firm, detaining
hand on the invalid&#8217;s shrunken arm, &#8220;please, don&#8217;t be
romantic and impulsive, dearest Amy&mdash;you know your
Irish heart is always too tender, and you are such an
easy prey to beggars and impostors. I ask you to give
me your help in working for the good of these two
foolish children, and when I say good, I honestly mean
it. As for years of indefinite waiting, letter-writing,
and constancy, I set my face against that <i>absolutely</i>.
I&#8217;ve known engagements&mdash;particularly where the man
is in India&mdash;to drag on for years and years, and I certainly<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_85"></a>[85]</span>
would not undertake to give Letty a home for
such a time, especially if she was expecting to make
a marriage of which I disapproved&mdash;yes&#8221; (second
thought), &#8220;and her uncle too. And even if she were
engaged to Lancelot for years, supposing he were to
die? Such things do happen. Where should I be,
then, with a disconsolate old maid on my hands?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Then what do you propose to do?&#8221; asked a
querulous voice from the sofa.</p>

<p>&#8220;It is <i>you</i>, dearest Amy, not I, who will move in the
affair.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Oh, impossible&mdash;out of the question,&#8221; she protested
with waving hands.</p>

<p>&#8220;Yes, it is the most sensible and easiest solution.
Were <i>I</i> to interfere, it would add fuel to the flame&mdash;if
flame there be&mdash;and Letty is so devoted to you that
she will listen to whatever <i>you</i> say, with patience and
attention. You can tell her that your nephew&#8217;s regiment
is next on the Roster for foreign service, and will
not return for years and years.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;But he is only going to Gibraltar and Egypt,&#8221;
objected Mrs. Denton.</p>

<p>&#8220;And India,&#8221; amended the visitor in her most
trenchant and matter-of-fact manner. &#8220;Assure her
that his prospects are excellent, but that marriage
would destroy them; that he has no money, and no
thought of taking a wife&mdash;&mdash;&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I&#8217;m afraid that last would not be true.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Well, please say whatever you think best,&#8221; said
Mrs. Fen irritably; &#8220;but do not leave one little chink<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_86"></a>[86]</span>
of hope. Believe me it will be the truest kindness!
When you reflect over what I have said, I know you
will see that I am right.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Yes, Dorothy,&#8221; assented Mrs. Denton; &#8220;I am
aware that you have more practical common sense
than all the rest of us put together&mdash;but&mdash;there is
something beside common sense, isn&#8217;t there?&mdash;love&mdash;constancy?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Oh, my dearest friend, the real name for your something
is &#8216;<i>Nonsense</i>.&#8217;&#8221; Then, standing up and arranging
her boa, she added impressively, &#8220;Surely, Amy,
you have your boy&#8217;s interest at heart, and is it to his
interest, that he should marry a girl who has not a
penny piece, and comes of a notoriously consumptive
family?&#8221;</p>

<p>She paused to allow this shaft to go home, and
then continued:</p>

<p>&#8220;I&#8217;ll send Letty up to-morrow afternoon with that
new book on gardening, and you might take the opportunity
of having a nice little talk with her. Now
good-bye, dearest friend,&#8221; and she stooped over the
couch, kissed the lady with tender affection, and so
departed. <i>That</i> was done!</p>

<p>For hours the same night Mrs. Denton lay awake
miserable and restless, wondering what she could say
to Letty, and how she was to say it; for it is a delicate
task to tell a girl that she must put away all thoughts
of your own nephew; and oh, how the poor cat&#8217;s-paw
hated and dreaded the ordeal. And yet it must be
faced&mdash;it would be, as Dorothy the wise had pointed<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_87"></a>[87]</span>
out, a fatal mistake for Lancelot to marry before he
got his company; and even then a girl without a penny
would hamper his future. She must put sentiment
from her, and think of Lancelot&#8217;s career.</p>

<p>Letty duly arrived with the book on gardens,
and remained to make tea. After a little desultory
talk about the bulbs, her terrified hostess broke the
ice.</p>

<p>&#8220;I had a few lines from Lancelot this morning&mdash;he
is back at Aldershot.&#8221;</p>

<p>At his name the girl coloured up, and looked
expectant.</p>

<p>&#8220;I don&#8217;t think we shall see him here for a long time.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;No.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;From Gibraltar his regiment goes on to Egypt,
and India.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;So he told me,&#8221; rejoined Letty with disconcerting
promptness. &#8220;How I envy them; I would give anything
to go to India, you know, I was born there!&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Yes; it&#8217;s a wonderfully interesting country. My
brother-in-law was in the Punjaub for years. I hope
Lance will get some staff appointment; he is working
hard, and in some ways foreign service has its advantages&mdash;at
home, there are so many distractions&mdash;and
temptations.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Temptations!&#8221; echoed Letty with a blank face.</p>

<p>&#8220;Yes, my dear, in the shape of pretty faces, and the
danger of falling in love. But Lancelot is poor; he has
only himself to rely on&mdash;he cannot afford to think of
love&mdash;much less marriage. You see he is but twenty-three,<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_88"></a>[88]</span>
and a subaltern; so it is best for him, as I say,
to go to India&mdash;and&#8221;&mdash;suddenly dropping her voice&mdash;&#8220;<i>forget</i>.&#8221;</p>

<p>To this long speech there was no reply; the slender
figure sitting with her back to the window never
moved.</p>

<p>Stirred by some rash impulse the kind woman added:</p>

<p>&#8220;I believe he was growing fond of <i>you</i>, Letty.&#8221;
The girl caught her breath. &#8220;But it would never,
never do, and the less he sees and thinks of you
the better. Poor fellow!&#8221; and she heaved a long
sigh.</p>

<p>And what of poor Letty?</p>

<p>She struggled desperately to restrain her tears, to
swallow an enormous lump in her throat, and to steady
and clench her trembling hands; fortunately the light
was growing dim and she wore a shady hat. At last
she said in a clear, rather sharp key:</p>

<p>&#8220;Of course, Mrs. Denton, you know best;&#8221; and now
came a great big lie: &#8220;Mr. Lumley and I were only
friends&mdash;he never thought of me in&mdash;in&mdash;the way you
mean.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I&#8217;m truly thankful to hear you say so, my dear,&#8221;
replied the lady, who was intensely relieved. &#8220;Now,
will you give me another cup of tea, and let us talk of
something else?&#8221;</p>

<p>It was not easy for Letty&#8217;s shaking hands to pour out
tea, and even more difficult to &#8216;talk of&#8217; something
else. The fragile invalid had just dealt her a shattering
blow, and all the exquisite whisperings of her young<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_89"></a>[89]</span>
hopes were crushed and silenced. Pride, the legacy
of generations, now came to her assistance, and she
discoursed of trifling village matters and the Ridgefield
bazaar with true Spartan fortitude, whilst all the
time a cruel, sharp-toothed fox, was rending her tender
heart.</p>

<p>When at last she rose to go, Mrs. Denton drew her
down and embraced her with unusual warmth and
significance. It was such a comfort that the dear
child had taken her talk in good part; and that night
to her prayers she added a few words of devout thankfulness,
and asked for a special blessing on Letty Glyn.
&#8220;The girl was too young to realise or reciprocate
Lancelot&#8217;s attachment; she was just a child, a
dear, dear child,&#8221; and with this consoling reflection,
Mrs. Denton closed her eyes, and slept the sleep of
the just, and the justified.</p>

<p>But Letty, as she walked up the village that star-lit
January evening, felt as if a door had been closed upon
her, and that darkness had descended on the world.</p>

<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_90"></a>[90]</span>

<h2 class="nobreak">CHAPTER VIII</h2>
</div>


<p class="drop-cap2">ALTHOUGH she searchingly scrutinised her niece&#8217;s
appearance, Mrs. Fenchurch failed to discover
any trace of actual misery in face or attitude. Certainly
Letty was pale; but the weather was exceptionally
trying, and Mrs. Denton, who had been as good as her
word, assured her that the child had taken her &#8216;little
talk&#8217; in the best part, and behaved beautifully!</p>

<p>Yet Letty, for all her outward composure, was absolutely
wretched; her little glimpse into Paradise had
been speedily eclipsed. So she must never think of
Lancelot Lumley, nor he of her, and she now seemed
to sit in a prison behind bars, and in outer darkness.
Her only comforts were her uncle, with his cheery nature
and his warm affection, and Sam the pug. Lancelot
had liked Sam, and said he was &#8216;a good sort,&#8217; and
up in her own room she confided many sorrows to Sam,
and laid her wet cheek against his velvet jowl, and
dropped tears over his fawn head, whilst he snorted,
goggled, and sympathised dog-fashion. Among her
little circle, it was surprising how reserved and secretive
Letty could be; the only one who divined her trouble,
was eagle-eyed Mrs. Hesketh&mdash;who understood and
marvelled at the little girl&#8217;s pride and fortitude. The
lady also experienced some sharp twinges from a<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_91"></a>[91]</span>
rather drowsy conscience. She had been wrong to
bring the young people together, and now, as she
half feared, <i>they</i> were paying. As a sop to her
remorse, she presented Letty with a superb sable
boa; but even this had no effect&mdash;positively it
might as well have been rabbit skin! for all the
girl seemed to care.</p>

<p>One evening Letty was returning from Oldcourt.
Something its mistress had said, a little word and a
sympathetic look, had touched her. She refrained
herself until she was alone in the dusk, and then gave
way to an outburst of tears&mdash;tears usually reserved
for the night, and her own apartment. But now she
wept openly and without restraint.</p>

<p>Fortunately there was no one to be seen, as she
walked on past The Holt to the Crooked Bridge,
and there sat down on the parapet, and had her cry
out. Here on this very bridge he had called her
&#8216;Letty,&#8217; here on the same spot, she must make up her
mind to thrust him out of her heart, and strangle
her folly. Oh, it was folly; cruel, painful, <i>aching</i>
folly! After a while she dried her eyes and proceeded
to make her way slowly homewards&mdash;earnestly hoping
that she might steal up to her own room unobserved;
but Fortune, as usual, failed to befriend her!</p>

<p>As she crept past the drawing-room door it stood
half open, and she caught a glimpse of her aunt sitting
at the fire in a ruminative attitude.</p>

<p>&#8220;Is that you, Letty?&#8221; she called out. &#8220;What
makes you so late? Come here, my dear!&#8221;</p>



<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_92"></a>[92]</span>Aunt Dorothy was apparently in a good-humour&mdash;possibly
the Duchess had called. Letty hastily glanced
into the hall glass, straightened her hat, and rubbed
her swollen eyes.</p>

<p>When she presented herself, Mrs. Fenchurch turned
half round in her chair, and stared as if she could not
believe her senses.</p>

<p>&#8220;Good God!&#8221; she exclaimed at last&mdash;in moments of
violent excitement she borrowed the forcible language
of her hard-riding brothers&mdash;&#8220;Where have you been?
and what has happened?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Happened?&#8221; repeated the girl in a dull voice.
&#8220;Nothing.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Come, there&#8217;s no use in telling me a lie&mdash;your eyes
look as if they were set in red flannel, and your face is
in dirty streaks!&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I&mdash;I&mdash;I&#8217;m afraid I&#8217;m getting a bad cold in my
head, Aunt Dorothy.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;How sickening! Friday&mdash;and this is Wednesday.
Well, you must go to bed at once, and take a large
dose of ammoniated quinine. As for your dinner, it
shall be gruel.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;But really, Aunt Dorothy&mdash;&mdash;&#8221; protested the
miserable victim.</p>

<p>&#8220;But really, Letty, you are a hideous object,&#8221; interrupted
Mrs. Fenchurch in her most inflexible manner.
&#8220;Your nose is swelled to the size of a turnip. I&#8217;ve
just had a note from Mr. Blagdon,&#8221; touching an envelope
in her lap. &#8220;He is back at Ridgefield, now the
thaw has come, and invites himself to lunch here on<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_93"></a>[93]</span>
Friday, so I&#8217;ve barely two days to patch you up and
make you fit to be seen. Now, my dear child, go off
at once and bundle into bed as quickly as you can;
I&#8217;ll bring you the gruel with lots of sulphur in it,
within half an hour.&#8221;</p>

<h2 class="nobreak">CHAPTER IX</h2>
</div>


<p class="drop-cap">FRIDAY morning was a busy bustling time at
The Holt, where elaborate preparations were
on foot for the reception of an important guest.</p>

<p>Mrs. Fenchurch prided herself on her housekeeping,
and boasted that she was always prepared for any
emergency or visitor&mdash;were it the King! Nevertheless
she now brought out the best dessert and coffee sets,
the precious old family silver, and spent half an hour
conferring with the cook. She had set Letty to arrange
flowers, put on fresh chintz covers, and feed and
incarcerate the dogs. Having issued orders to her
husband with respect to the cellar, warned the stable-yard
with regard to horses, she changed into her
Sunday gown and best rings, saw that Letty wore the
new green cloth&mdash;and behold all was in readiness.</p>

<p>Half-past one o&#8217;clock&mdash;two&mdash;half-past two&mdash;and yet
Mr. Blagdon never appeared. Mrs. Fenchurch had
ceased to cast surreptitious glances at the window, and
her husband&#8217;s patience was exhausted. Without a
word to his wife he rose and boldly dragged at the bell,
and to the answering servant uttered one stentorian
word, &#8220;<i>Lunch!</i>&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I&#8217;m hanged if I&#8217;m going to wait for that fellow any
longer,&#8221; he announced with the courage of a hungry<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_95"></a>[95]</span>
man. &#8220;Just like Blagdon&mdash;inviting himself to honour
us&mdash;you and Letty work like blacks, and he never
turns up after all!&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;That will do, dear&mdash;that will do&mdash;don&#8217;t get excited,&#8221;
said his wife, patting his arm. She was secretly
furious with Blagdon. &#8220;He has made some mistake;
however, there is capital mulligatawny, and now we
will go and enjoy it ourselves.&#8221;</p>

<p>The housekeeper&#8217;s boast was well founded; her
husband and niece thoroughly appreciated the good
things intended for a non-arrival&mdash;indeed, Letty&#8217;s
appetite was whetted by a sense of intense relief, but
Mrs. Fen scarcely touched a morsel, being herself devoured
by cruel misgivings.</p>

<p>The following afternoon as they sat at table, a smart
yellow-wheeled Stanhope dashed up to the door with
much crunching and spattering of gravel. It was
driven by the belated Blagdon!</p>

<p>Colonel Fenchurch with a muttered oath, cast his
serviette on the floor, and hurried into the hall to welcome
the unexpected guest. Meanwhile, Mrs. Fenchurch
rang the bell distractedly, gave orders for the
ham (luckily uncut), grapes, Burgundy, and to make
coffee at once; then, turning to Letty, she surveyed
her with dismay.</p>

<p>&#8220;And you in your old school frock! Oh, it&#8217;s simply
maddening, and I believe the drawing-room fire is out.
Here, get up quickly, and sit at this side with your
back to the light, and perhaps your old serge won&#8217;t
show.&#8221;</p>



<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_96"></a>[96]</span>Blagdon now entered, suave and well groomed, full
of apologies and easy talk. To himself he remarked,
that Fenchurch was a stiff-necked ceremonious old
beggar, but he knew that Mrs. Fen was <i>his</i> friend!
He had proposed himself as a visitor, partly to discover
what sort of people the Fenchurchs were when at home,
and also to see how the land lay, and if the girl was
really as pretty as his memory had painted.</p>

<p>The lunch, although shorn of yesterday&#8217;s splendour,
proved excellent; the wine first-class, the appointments,
furniture, and old portraits, intimated that the Fenchurch
family had handsome ancestors of taste and
fortune. The topics discussed were chiefly hunting,
the local pack and followers, other packs, and Mr.
Blagdon, a hard rider (who, when he could not get over
a country, went <i>through</i> it), gave vivid descriptions of
runs with the Pytchley, and the Quorn.</p>

<p>After cigars and coffee the guest was conducted with
much pomp and ceremony to inspect the chrysanthemums.
Unfortunately the celebrated Holt gardens
were now looking their worst; these were lovely in
spring and summer, but at present, all the blooms
were in the greenhouses, where, although not specially
remarkable, the Japanese specimens made a respectable
show. Personally Blagdon knew as little of a
chrysanthemum as he did of a cauliflower&mdash;but he
assumed a knowledge he did not possess; in his own
bluff fashion he made himself agreeable to his hostess,
and she (an able chaperon) arranged that he and Letty
should have a few moments in the conservatory alone,<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_97"></a>[97]</span>
whilst she &#8216;ran&#8217; to give an important message to the
head-gardener.</p>

<p>Alas, of these precious moments the great <i>parti</i>
failed to avail himself. It was a bitterly cold, raw
day, Letty had been all the morning indoors assisting
to wash the china (and her aunt had been unusually
snappy and unreasonable), the walk across the lawn
had given her beautiful nose a tinge of pink, the girl&#8217;s
gown was a shapeless, ill-made blue serge; her shoes
were worn white at the toes, and she hadn&#8217;t a word to
throw to a dog! The aunt did all the talking. If
Hugo Blagdon had cherished any intention of taking
the irrevocable step, this intention now died the death.
He was sensitive and easily influenced by his environment,
and the impression made on him by Miss Glyn at
home, was distinctly the reverse of that made by Miss
Glyn abroad. There, she was a well-dressed radiant
beauty; here, a poor, shabby Cinderella, with timid
eyes, and cold, red hands.</p>

<p>After a depressing round of the damp, wintry
gardens, and a brief stay in the charming drawing-room,
full of old cabinets, pastel portraits, Chippendale
furniture, and other treasures, Mr. Blagdon offered a
few vague and agreeable remarks, and begged leave to
order his carriage.</p>

<p>When the bay steppers came prancing to the hall
door, the visitor made a genial and general farewell,
and so drove away. As the last rumble of his wheels
was heard in the distance Mrs. Fenchurch turned and
looked searchingly at Letty, as if she wished to ask<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_98"></a>[98]</span>
her something. She fidgeted about the drawing-room,
dusting little things with her handkerchief, taking up
and laying down books; but before she could put her
questions into words, her terrified niece had effected
her escape. Mrs. Fen was well aware, that Letty had
her reserves, and for the remainder of the afternoon
she sat alone over the fire, with a book in her lap,
but instead of reading, her eyes were fixed upon
the coals, her active mind was elsewhere; she was
lost in speculations. Had he said anything&mdash;or not?</p>

<p>If her niece Letty were to marry the great catch&mdash;despair
of many mothers&mdash;<i>how</i> she would score!
Already she was anticipating her triumphs. The dining-room
would seat seventy with a squeeze; she would get
the cake at Buzzards&#8217;; cards of invitation at the
stores; and borrow a veil from Cecilia.</p>

<p>A few days later, in glancing over <i>The Morning Post</i>,
she came upon this paragraph:</p>

<p>&#8220;Mr. H. Blagdon and party arrived at the H&ocirc;tel de
Paris, Monte Carlo, on the 7th inst., for the season.&#8221;</p>

<p>Alas, alas, alas! A castle in the air had toppled
down, and great was the fall thereof!</p>

<p>Mrs. Fenchurch&#8217;s first sensation was insensate fury
with the girl; her second, a devout thankfulness that
beyond her own household&mdash;that is to say, her husband
and Cousin Maude&mdash;she had not trumpeted forth
her hopes&mdash;since they had come to nothing.</p>

<p>Her manner to her niece now underwent an abrupt
change; the wind instead of blowing from the south
had set steadily into the east, and there remained.<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_99"></a>[99]</span>
Fires in Letty&#8217;s bedroom and other small indulgences
came to an end, and this particular month of February
was, for several reasons, the most miserable the girl
had ever known. Nothing that she did, or said, or
wore, seemed to please Aunt Dorothy, and one day,
after an undeserved scolding, the poor worm turned at
last and said:</p>

<p>&#8220;I know, Aunt Dorothy, that I am one too many
here.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;How dare you say such a thing, you impertinent
minx!&#8221; stormed her relative.</p>

<p>&#8220;But it is the truth,&#8221; argued Letty, plucking up
some courage. &#8220;I am not happy, and you are not
happy, and we really cannot go on in this way. I
should like to return to Dresden; they will find me a
place in the school as music teacher.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I never heard such insolence and nonsense!&#8221; cried
Mrs. Fenchurch, her face red with temper. &#8220;Do you
suppose your uncle would allow his niece to go out
as a governess&mdash;earn her bread&mdash;and have everyone
talking?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Well, many girls who are as good, or probably far
better than I am, do it,&#8221; declared Letty, controlling
her tears with difficulty; &#8220;and my master said
that, with practice, I would make a professional
singer.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Worse and worse. Why, you will be clamouring
to go upon the stage next! Be so good as to understand,
that you remain here, and do exactly as <i>I</i> wish,
until you are one-and-twenty. Of course, someone may<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_100"></a>[100]</span>
marry you, but penniless girls haven&#8217;t much chance of
that in these times.&#8221;</p>

<p>Mrs. Fenchurch on every other subject was perfectly
sane and reasonable; the exception was her
husband&#8217;s niece. She was pretty, she was young, she
was <i>de trop</i>, and her aunt sincerely hated her. Undoubtedly
the unhappy young woman had got upon
her nerves&mdash;the bitter disappointment after such exalted
hopes, worked in her mind like a deadly poison.
It was true that Letty had made an unexpected sensation
at the ball, and at the Bonhams&#8217; dance, but so far
her triumph had borne no fruit. The weather had been
dreadful, going about the country was out of the
question, the roads were impassable with rain or
snow, so Mrs. Fenchurch had been thrown back upon
herself&mdash;there was no hunting, no gardening; Mothers&#8217;
Meetings and Village Choral Society failed to content
her, and her sole outlet was Cousin Maude. To Oldcourt
she carried her grievances, but Cousin Maude refused
to see eye to eye with her, and generally took the part
of Letty. If the girl was forgetful, if she had given a
short answer, if she had slammed a door, after all, she
was young; her life was not very exciting&mdash;and who
is perfect?</p>

<p>As for Letty herself, maddened by gibes, reproaches,
and a lacerating tongue, at night she would wander
round her room like a prisoner, wondering how she
was to escape, wondering who could help her. Cousin
Maude was her friend, but powerless; intercourse
with Oldcourt was now strictly curtailed. Uncle Tom<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_101"></a>[101]</span>
was attached to her, but entirely dominated by his
wife.</p>

<p>Colonel Fenchurch had not been insensible to the
suppressed antagonism and strained relations between
aunt and niece; inwardly and with all his sore heart,
he sided with Letty; but though physically bold as a
lion, the little man lacked moral courage; he could
face the biggest fence without flinching, but he dared
not face Doodie and stand between her and her
unreasonable treatment of his sister&#8217;s orphan; the
situation filled him with secret bitterness and self-contempt.
Hitherto, he had been absolutely content
with his comfortable, well-ordered home, his well-bred
hunters, and his masterful invaluable Doodie,
till the girl had come to make a third at The Holt;
and now in his eyes, his watchful consort frequently
read questions, protests, and reproach.</p>

<p>And all on account of this detestable interloper!</p>

<p>In spite of his breezy, jaunty manner, it was no secret
in the house or village, that the Colonel had a fine grey
mare in his stable, and it was whispered that lately
there had been rows; loud talking and angry voices
overheard in the drawing-room long after Miss Glyn
had gone to bed&mdash;but vain was the effort to dislodge
the yoke of years!</p>

<p>The east wind had been particularly trying to Mrs.
Fenchurch&#8217;s neuralgia, she had received a disappointing
post, and carried away by this combination of
circumstances, she vented her feelings on Letty, who
had been so unfortunate as to upset a bottle of ink.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_102"></a>[102]</span>&#8220;Oh, what a mess! my good cover ruined!&#8221; she
cried. &#8220;You never <i>can</i> do anything right or like other
people. If only someone would marry you, and take
you out of my house and out of my sight, I&#8217;d give a
thousand pounds!&#8221;</p>

<p>Pacing up and down her room that same afternoon,
her thoughts darting in all directions like some frantic
sorely pressed fugitive, Letty came to a momentous
decision. Escape for her life she must, and somehow!
She had no money, no home to receive her; there was
but one alternative, and as she stood in the window
looking out on the bleak prospect, she vowed to herself
that she would marry the very first man who asked
her&mdash;yes, she <i>would</i>. Having made this desperate
resolution, she broke down, burst into tears, and ran
and buried her face in her pillow, in case her next-door
neighbour (a housemaid) might overhear her
too audible, and convulsive sobs.</p>

<p>Shortly after this scene, the unfortunate girl &#8216;brought
home,&#8217; as Mrs. Fenchurch expressed it, influenza from
a cottage in the village, and was <i>hors de combat</i> for
three weeks&mdash;entailing extra trouble to the servants,
a visit from the local doctor, and a chemist&#8217;s bill.</p>

<p>Then one afternoon towards the end of March, Mrs.
Fenchurch herself climbed up to visit the patient; her
presence always made the girl&#8217;s heart flutter&mdash;beyond
words to express she dreaded being alone with Aunt
Dorothy; but on this occasion Aunt Dorothy looked
almost agreeable, and was carrying in her hand a
box which was addressed to &#8216;Miss Glyn, The Holt,<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_103"></a>[103]</span>
Thornby,&#8217; and had been despatched from the south of
France.</p>

<p>&#8220;This has just come for you, Letty, and I have
brought it up myself,&#8221; said Mrs. Fenchurch breathlessly.
&#8220;Here are a pair of scissors&mdash;now let us see
what is inside.&#8221;</p>

<p>To Letty&#8217;s amazement the box contained a quantity
of exquisite exotic flowers despatched by a well-known
florist in Monte Carlo. On the top of these, lay a card
on which was inscribed, &#8220;From H. Blagdon, with all
good wishes.&#8221;</p>

<p>And once more, hope whispered a flattering tale to
the matchmaker. Was she to have her own way with
the world, after all?</p>

<p>&#8220;Oh, they are from Mr. Blagdon!&#8221; exclaimed the
girl. &#8220;Surely there must be some mistake&mdash;how very
funny!&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;How very kind, you should say,&#8221; corrected her
aunt. &#8220;I am positive they couldn&#8217;t have cost a penny
less than fifty francs&mdash;just look at these carnations
and orchids! We will have some vases and put them
about the room.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;No, no, no,&#8221; protested Letty; &#8220;please not! I
don&#8217;t like hothouse flowers in a bedroom; but do you
take them; they will look beautiful below stairs.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Oh, very well, <i>I</i> never refuse a good offer,&#8221; declared
her visitor, collecting them into the box. &#8220;I
suppose you will write and thank him?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Must I?&#8221; asked the invalid with flickering colour.</p>

<p>&#8220;Well, perhaps as you are not feeling very well I had<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_104"></a>[104]</span>
better do it for you; the post goes out in ten minutes,&#8221;
and carrying the flowers in one hand, with the precious
card in the other, Mrs. Fenchurch effected a precipitate
departure.</p>

<p>Whatever Mrs. Fenchurch had said in her letter,
the result was, that boxes of flowers now arrived
at The Holt about twice a week; and once more the
atmosphere within, thawed with the atmosphere
without!</p>

<h2 class="nobreak">CHAPTER X</h2>
</div>


<p class="drop-cap">HUGO BLAGDON was a well-known habitu&eacute;
of Monte Carlo, and he fled thither early in
February to avoid an English spring, and escape from
a personality that threatened to lure him into the noose
of matrimony! His grandfather had been overseer
in a coal mine, and his father, Laban, a clever man of
ceaseless energy and enterprise, had, by his own efforts,
risen to vast wealth. He was a typical Yorkshire
tyke; hard-headed, hard-bitten, and plain of speech,
standing squarely on his feet and his principles.
When over fifty, he had disposed of his collieries to a
syndicate, and looked about him for a country estate,
and a suitable consort. At this time Sharsley, the
ancient seat of the Scropes, happened to be in the
market; the family had fallen on evil days, and the
last representative was a thin, dignified old gentleman,
with an empty purse and many spinster daughters.
During tedious negotiations, the would-be purchaser
made acquaintance with the Squire&#8217;s family, and
when he took over the property, he also received the
taper hand of the stateliest and slenderest of the
Scrope sisters. Ill-natured gossips declared that in
consequence of this arrangement, the canny Yorkshire-man<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_106"></a>[106]</span>
had obtained an abatement of ten thousand
pounds on the price of the property&mdash;but envious
people will say anything! Mrs. Blagdon&#8217;s aristocratic
relations agreed that dearest Carrie, who was &#8216;getting
on,&#8217; had done remarkably well for herself; the bride
was perfectly satisfied with her honest, stolid husband,
and he for his part felt proud of his Carrie; she
matched Sharsley, and naturally was far more at home
there than himself. Mrs. Blagdon fulfilled her duties
to admiration; an elegant, dignified figure, she sat
at the head of his table, glorious and dazzling in the
new Blagdon diamonds, entertaining her neighbours
with gracious distinction. Moreover, she was most
kind and thoughtful to her husband&#8217;s family, especially
to his old aunt, Fanny Jane, who spoke
broad Yorkshire, had not marched with the times,
and preferred to dine at one o&#8217;clock&mdash;and in her
bonnet.</p>

<p>Having figuratively emerged from coal to the
surface, Laban Blagdon entered into country life with
enthusiasm; he farmed, he supported the hounds
and the Yeomanry, and sat on the Bench with commendable
punctuality. His first-born was a girl.
Four years later her brother arrived on this planet,
amidst great rejoicings. Blagdon of Sharsley was
immensely proud of his children; he had none of his
father&#8217;s ideas of stern discipline, and was an extravagantly
indulgent parent. In his opinion, nothing was
too good for Connie and Hugo&mdash;the pair could do no
wrong.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_107"></a>[107]</span>Possibly his partiality was due to the fact that they
were true Blagdons; large-boned, and loud of voice,
exhibiting no traces whatever of their mother&#8217;s
ancestry. This poor lady did her utmost to influence
them, exerting herself surprisingly for a Scrope, but
somehow she never became familiar with her boy and
girl, who emancipated themselves as soon as they had
quitted the nursery. And their mother found it difficult
to believe, that this rough, boisterous, undisciplined
couple, were actually her own offspring. Had they
been those of other people, she would have lifted
her delicate hands, and declared them to be young
savages!</p>

<p>Hugo was sent to a preparatory school, and then to
Eton; he rode well, knew the points of a horse, was
thoroughly at home in the stables, had a hearty laugh,
a huge appetite, and his father thought him an uncommonly
fine lad! As for Connie, she was the apple
of Laban Blagdon&#8217;s eye; a bit of a hoyden, and no
great beauty, but a girl who could stick on a horse,
sing a good song, hold her own in talk, and what more
did you want?</p>

<p>The year that Connie was presented to her sovereign
her father died suddenly of apoplexy, and was widely
and sincerely regretted; sound to the core, a just
landlord and employer, a good friend, and a generous
foe. His heir was at sixteen a well-grown youth, with
a thick-set figure, a strong will, rather surly manners,
and an exaggerated sense of his own importance.
From Eton, he went (with great reluctance) to Oxford,<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_108"></a>[108]</span>
and there his idleness and scrapes gained him a certain
amount of notoriety.</p>

<p>As for his sister, she was launched in London
Society, with considerable &eacute;clat by her mother&#8217;s
aristocratic connections; Connie had no taste for balls
or the usual round of gaiety, but developed an
unexpected passion for racing! At Newmarket she
encountered her affinity; a good-looking, graceless
baronet, who had run through his patrimony on the
turf, and did not bear an enviable reputation. However,
in spite of all that her mother, relations, and
trustees, could urge or threaten, Connie Blagdon
insisted on marrying Teddy Rashleigh. She was,
as her father had often declared, &#8220;a fine, strapping
girl, who knew her own mind, with a handsome fortune
pinned on to her skirts&#8221;; and Sir Teddy was not
indifferent to this agreeable fact.</p>

<p>At first, the happy pair travelled about from one
race meeting to another, enjoying an atmosphere of
continual and stimulating excitement. In winter,
they went abroad, returning in time for the first Spring
Meeting. After a few years of a gay and rambling
existence, came much harassing anxiety, rumours of
serious troubles about racing and gambling debts;
these rumours were followed by the sudden death of
Sir Teddy Rashleigh. An overdose of sulphonal, taken
by mistake (his creditors had their own opinions as to
the &#8216;mistake&#8217;), and his widow found herself at the age
of twenty-eight, with the miserable remains of a
large fortune, and alienated from all her friends.<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_109"></a>[109]</span>
During her married life, she had acquired extravagant
and reckless tastes, gambled, betted, and plunged&mdash;and
oh, how she hated poverty!</p>

<p>Fortunately, she and her brother had always been
chums, and he now came so generously to her assistance,
that most of her world believed Lady Rashleigh to be
not only a gay, but wealthy widow. She was loud,
good-natured, and plain; a big woman, with high,
square shoulders, quantities of coarse brown hair
(dyed red), a broad, shrewd face, redeemed by a set of
flashing white teeth. Men called her &#8220;a rare good sort,
and as clever as they make them,&#8221; meaning that Lady
Rashleigh, knew her world thoroughly, and contrived,
whilst keeping on bowing terms with Mrs. Grundy, to
enjoy a remarkably festive time.</p>

<p>Meanwhile Hugo, his own master for many years,
had been engaged in sowing wild oats, and seeing life.
His mother had taken her departure from Sharsley;
this severance had been a heart-breaking business,
but Hugo&#8217;s manners and customs, and Hugo&#8217;s associates,
were altogether too much for that delicate,
decorous, and mid-Victorian matron. Instead of family
prayers, and breakfast at nine o&#8217;clock, Hugo&#8217;s lady
guests appeared at midday. They smoked, talked
slang, discussed the latest odds, the latest scandals,
and more or less ignored their old-fashioned hostess;
the men were even worse: a gambling, hard-drinking,
horsy crew; so Mrs. Blagdon went away to Cannes,
and established herself in a splendid villa, far aloof
from her unsatisfactory and unfilial children.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_110"></a>[110]</span>Sharsley, thus abandoned, was consigned to the care
of a tall, dashing housekeeper, known as Mrs. Bates,
who wore rich silk gowns, expensive jewellery, rouged
heavily, and knew all about the best brands of champagne.
To do her justice, she was a capable and active
person, thoroughly experienced in the management
of servants, had a tongue like a whip-lash, and understood
the art of getting work out of her subordinates&mdash;whilst
she looked on. Two or three times a year there
were house-parties for shooting and hunting, and on
these occasions Lady Rashleigh, who, needless to add,
had always kept on the best of terms with her brother,
was the jolly, easy-going hostess; a totally different
ch&acirc;telaine to her frigid mother, and not easily surprised,
daunted, or shocked. Few were aware that Connie
had a very small income, (though her extravagant
tastes were well-known,) and it was important that she
should stand well with Hugo. He paid the rent of her
London flat, her hotel bills when she accompanied him
abroad, made her presents of frocks and furs, and was
altogether a really generous brother. For her part, she
listened to his grievances with sympathetic interest,
cultivated his particular friends, gave charming little
dinners and suppers, and was ever ready to play
chaperon, buffer, or confidante.</p>

<p>Blagdon had naturally a wide circle of acquaintances,
and was a good deal spoiled by the flattery which is
habitually offered to an open-handed bachelor with
the income of a prince. He had a special coterie of
associates, known to envious scoffers as the &#8216;pack.&#8217;<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_111"></a>[111]</span>
Chief in importance was Lord Robert Cheyne (first
cousin to Blagdon on the Scrope side); this hard-riding,
round-backed little gentleman, had bright,
twinkling brown eyes, and a forehead so lofty that
it seemed to stretch half-way across his poll&mdash;and
imparted a worshipful, sedate, and middle-aged
appearance,&mdash;flatly contradicted by his lordship&#8217;s
character and years. He had a kind heart, a dull
brain, and a lean purse, and believed Cousin Hugo,
&#8220;who gave him lots of shootin&#8217; and huntin&#8217;,&#8221; to
be a rare good sportin&#8217; sort, and one of the
best!</p>

<p>Next, the Baron Van Krab, a fair, well-set-up man
of forty, a Britisher of Dutch extraction, and not
unknown in the City. Captain Herdby, a retired
cavalryman, handsome, well bred, well groomed, somewhat
mysterious as to his antecedents, but knowing
(or pretending to know) the great world, and ready to
ride, dine, shoot, dance, or fill any gap at a moment&#8217;s
notice. Sir Thomas and Lady Slater, &#8216;Foxy and
Shocky&#8217; as they were nicknamed; he being a little man
with a bright, cunning eye, a bushy red moustache,
and the legs of a jockey; a conspicuous patron of the
turf; his wife, also devoted to racing, was a tall,
showy-looking woman, with a large mouth, magnificent
teeth, and an ever-ready laugh. She made an imposing
figure in evening dress, told the most outrageous stories,
and had an insatiable appetite for gossip and presents.
But Mr. Blagdon&#8217;s most particular friend was Mrs.
Fred Corbett, an attractive free-lance, with a willowy<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_112"></a>[112]</span>
form, and a pair of wonderful amber eyes; a glittering
creature, all frivolity, extravagance, and selfishness,
separated from her husband, (who, it was said, had
some vague occupation in the Argentine,) and Connie
Rashleigh&#8217;s <i>ch&egrave;re amie</i>.</p>

<p>When Hugo arrived at Monte Carlo, he found the
two ladies already installed at the Hermitage, the
Baron and the Slaters were at the Paris.</p>

<p>The great man was naturally hailed with sincere and
fervent joy, and, for his part, he was not indifferent to
the adulation of his little court; he enjoyed listening
to their spicy gossip, delicate and highly seasoned
flatteries, whilst he steeped himself in sunshine and
luxury. He gave his circle dinners and luncheons, yes
and loans; lavished flowers and attentions on his
sister and Lola Corbett, and was altogether in unusual
good-humour, and as the guests put it, &#8216;great
form.&#8217;</p>

<p>By the end of a fortnight, Monte and his associates
had begun to pall on Blagdon; even the rooms had lost
their fascination. The Baron had bet him a hundred
pounds on pigeon-shooting&mdash;and won. Foxy Slater
had put him on an outsider and let him in heavily,
and the Slaters and Connie talked racing or roulette by
the hour, and bored him to death.</p>

<p>As for Lola, she made awful play with her eyes, said
poisonous things of other women, and was losing her
looks! It was just at this critical period, that Letty
Glyn was once more introduced to his attention. A
casual remark from an utter stranger, threw, so to<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_113"></a>[113]</span>
speak, this beautiful, innocent, unhappy girl, into
Blagdon&#8217;s arms.</p>

<p>The gay season at Monte had reached high water,
and he daily came across acquaintances. Lounging
one morning against the parapet below the Casino
with Colonel Roland&mdash;a man who belonged to his
club&mdash;they idly watched the gay world go by.
Here were men and women of all nations, and reputations;
the most famous names in Europe were
pacing that sunny promenade. The two noted
and remarked on various familiar faces&mdash;princesses,
duchesses, dancers, statesmen, actors, authors, and
flocks of ordinary, and extraordinary, birds of
passage.</p>

<p>&#8220;Full-dress parade,&#8221; said Roland, chucking away
the end of an excellent cigar. &#8220;They are all very well&mdash;fine
feathers make fine birds!&mdash;but if you ask <i>me</i>, there
isn&#8217;t a woman here can touch that little Miss What&#8217;s-her-name
that was at the Brakesby Hunt Ball; she
could give every one of &#8217;em a stone and a beating.
Yes&#8221;&mdash;with a nudge&mdash;&#8220;and I saw <i>you</i> dancing with
her, you dog! Oh, you have an eye in your head,
and know what&#8217;s what. Of course, she is very young,
and does not realise her own value, yet&mdash;but if she had
half a chance, her beauty would be&mdash;be&mdash;&#8221; casting
about for a simile, &#8220;famous, the talk of England!&#8221;</p>

<p>Blagdon looked hard at his friend, and drawled
indifferently&mdash;</p>

<p>&#8220;Think so?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;<i>Sure</i>; and now I&#8217;m off to golf. Ta, ta; see<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_114"></a>[114]</span>
you at dinner!&#8221; and he walked away. Blagdon remained;
he selected and lit another cigar, and settled
himself to meditate. Roland was a good judge; he
had knocked about a bit. But the girl as he had last
seen her!</p>

<p>&#8220;That,&#8221; argued common sense, &#8220;was merely the
shabby dress and shoes that had choked him off. Yes,
and her cold red hands. All her aunt&#8217;s fault&mdash;stingy old
devil! At the ball, she was well turned out&mdash;and what
a difference! And, by George! he could afford to dress
his wife properly. A beauty that would be famous,
Mrs. Hugo Blagdon&mdash;!&#8221;</p>

<p>Once more his thoughts were concentrated on Thornby&mdash;thoughts
which subsequently simmered in his brain
for days. Little did Mrs. Corbett suspect them. Her
extravagance was increasing, she was a true daughter
of the horse leech, and her ceaseless cry was &#8220;Give,
give!&#8221; Every morning before they went into the
Rooms, she would take a little turn with Blagdon,
conduct him to the shops, and gaze pathetically into
a milliner&#8217;s, go into raptures over a fifty-pound cloak
or gown, then pilot her companion to the <i>Galerie</i>
Charles III, and a certain jeweller&#8217;s, where she gloated
over one particular necklace. She would gaze at this,
and then at her escort, and sigh, and sigh; but in spite
of these seductive arts, for once in his life Blagdon proved
invulnerable. Little did his companion guess, when he
strolled about looking into windows, and criticising
their contents, that all the time he was thinking how
well such an ornament, or hat or frock, would become<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_115"></a>[115]</span>
someone else!&mdash;a little girl in a remote old village, in
far-away England. If Letty Glyn had frocks and jewels,
she would cut them all out. He had given tons of
pretty things to the greedy woman beside him, and
paid tribute in not a few staggering dressmaker&#8217;s bills.
Yes, he was aware that Lola was dying for the
emerald necklace&mdash;but he was not to be drawn!</p>

<h2 class="nobreak">CHAPTER XI</h2>
</div>


<p class="drop-cap">SAUNTERING along the Casino terrace enjoying
a morning cigar, attended by the Baron and
Mrs. Corbett, Blagdon was unaffectedly disgusted when
a gigantic and majestic Grand Duke accosted the latter,
and after a brief parley annexed the lady, to
accompany and amuse <i>him</i>&mdash;leaving the great man,
deserted and despoiled. At <i>d&eacute;jeuner</i> Lola reappeared
in radiant spirits, cajoling, irresistible, and full of
stories about the Duke. She had met him in Paris,
Vienna, and Marienbad, they were old <i>old</i> friends.
The Duke was so enormously interested in Hugo and
anxious to make his acquaintance, had heard of his
lovely place, his splendid hunters, his first-rate shooting.
She was dining with the Duke that night, and
would bring off the introduction later; Hugo was
both mollified and flattered. He considered himself
the equal of any potentate, but by all accounts this
particular Russian Prince, with versts of shooting and
millions of roubles, might prove a satisfactory acquaintance.
After <i>d&eacute;jeuner</i> he went into the Rooms, and was
so successful at the tables, and so pleased with himself
and the world in general, that he subsequently strolled
over to the <i>galerie</i>, and purchased the coveted necklace
on which Mrs. Corbett had long set envious eyes.<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_117"></a>[117]</span>
Well, after all, it cost <i>him</i> nothing&mdash;it came out of the
pockets of the Administration and really was a remarkably
neat thing&mdash;a diamond collar, with large
drops of cabochon emeralds.</p>

<p>In the evening, the Rooms were crowded. Blagdon
played again, but was out of luck, and also a little out
of humour. He had seen the Countess of Boncaster
stare fixedly at his sister, and cut her dead. Connie
had too much rouge on; she looked dishevelled
and excited, and was gambling recklessly&mdash;yet it was
only the other day that he had squared up her betting
book, and she had sworn to economise and reform.</p>

<p>Wandering through the rooms, in a doorway he suddenly
encountered Mrs. Corbett and the gigantic Grand
Duke; he was about to halt, but amazing to relate, the
lady glanced over his head with cold, unseeing eyes, and
so passed on. He paused transfixed, and stared after the
pair. Lola was chattering French, and gazing up at
the great hulking Tartar, with her most alluring expression.
How well he knew it! He watched them
as they circled a table, and melted away into the
crowd. The burly Russian, and his graceful companion,
who was actually wearing diamonds that he,
Blagdon, had paid for&mdash;yes, and the very gown on her
back! As he stood motionless and bewildered, for once
experiencing the sting of smarting vanity, and dwelling
on the late decisive incident, the Baron accosted him,
with a scared white face.</p>

<p>&#8220;I have been looking for you all over the shop,&#8221; he
began. &#8220;I say, old chap, I&#8217;m cleared out. Can you<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_118"></a>[118]</span>
let me have a couple of <i>mille</i> notes, just to go on with?
I&#8217;ll pay you back of course.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I have only one left,&#8221; rejoined Blagdon in a sulky
voice, as he reluctantly produced and handed over a
note, then before the Baron could thank him he had
turned away, and abandoned the Casino for the cool,
moonlit gardens. Here he lit a cigar, sat down alone
under a clump of Bamboos, and said to himself, he was
going to have a good solid think. Blagdon had inherited
a certain amount of his father&#8217;s shrewdness, and this
on rare occasions struggled to the surface, and he
beheld his associates by the light of common
sense. Connie and her racing debts; the penniless
Baron and his borrowings; Lola, her bills and
jewellery&mdash;a greedy pack, all for themselves! If he
were a pauper, not one of them would come near him.
Then a beautiful innocent face rose before his mental
vision. What a contrast to the painted, powdered,
artificial women of his acquaintance! <i>She</i> was the
genuine article: her lovely hair and complexion were
her own. And yet he was not in love with her, but
with an idea, that if he were to marry Letty Glyn, his
wife, as Roland said, would be one of the most beautiful
women in England. Wherever she was seen, she
would make a tremendous sensation. At the Ball, and
at the Bonhams&#8217; how she had eclipsed everyone. The
resolve sprang up suddenly in his mind, Miss Glyn
was the right sort of wife for him. He was a man who
desired to possess the best of everything&mdash;chiefly in
order to excite the envy of others&mdash;and as he sat smoking<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_119"></a>[119]</span>
and musing, the image of Letty gathered shape and
distinctness. Finally he rose, threw the stump of
his cigar among the bushes, and muttered under
his breath:</p>

<p>&#8220;By Jove, I&#8217;ll do it!&#8221;</p>

<p>Next morning, with a touch of unusual restraint,
Blagdon dissembled his wrath with Lola Corbett,
and accepted her playful enquiry as to &#8220;why he had
never come near her in the Casino?&#8221; with commendable
indifference.</p>

<p>&#8220;The Duke was longing to meet you,&#8221; she lied.
&#8220;We searched for you everywhere. Now he has gone
off to Paris. He left by the morning train.&#8221;</p>

<p>To which Hugo (also lying) replied with complete
<i>sang-froid</i>:</p>

<p>&#8220;All right, better luck next time&mdash;express my
profound regrets when you write!&#8221;</p>

<p>Mrs. Corbett surveyed him under her thick black
lashes. So Hugo could joke; he had not noticed&mdash;what
a relief!</p>

<p>&#8220;Oh, Hugo,&#8221; she resumed, with well-simulated
animation, &#8220;what <i>do</i> you think, some dreadful person
has bought my adorable pet necklace&mdash;wasn&#8217;t it wicked
of them? When I went to pay it my daily visit, it was
gone. Who can have bought it?&#8221; and she looked at
him sharply, but Hugo merely struck a match, and
shook his head.</p>

<p>&#8220;He probably has it in his pocket the whole time,&#8221;
the lady assured herself, for she had entered the shop
full of anxious enquiries, and received a most particular<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_120"></a>[120]</span>
description of the purchaser, and his name&mdash;since
Blagdon was a well-known figure, and a generous
customer to many of the establishments in the principality.</p>

<p>No later than the next morning it was Mrs. Corbett&#8217;s
turn to be the victim of a disagreeable surprise. She
discovered Hugo in the principal florist&#8217;s, in the act
of despatching his offering to The Holt. &#8220;Miss Glyn,&#8221;
she read aloud over his shoulder. &#8220;Oh, you sly, sly
Hugo! If you send these floral tributes to that pretty
little schoolgirl, her aunt will snap you up before you
know where you are; and she will be a thousand times
worse than any mother-in-law&mdash;a hateful, managing,
dangerous woman.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I know how to take care of myself,&#8221; he answered
sullenly; &#8220;and flowers are only flowers&mdash;just a little
civility and nothing more.&#8221;</p>

<p>Mrs. Corbett&#8217;s shot about the aunt had gone home;
and Blagdon actually began to waver with respect to
the resolution he had made in the garden. He had a
horror of being what is called &#8216;managed&#8217;&mdash;he who
was so successfully exploited by his sister and his
friends&mdash;and if only Lola could have let well alone, his
idea of Letty Glyn might possibly have faded; but as
it was, she was continually chaffing about &#8216;his little
village maid,&#8217; &#8216;his pretty schoolgirl, and her pinafores,&#8217;
and Hugo Blagdon, was a man who could not stand
being laughed at,&mdash;although he keenly enjoyed seeing
others turned into ridicule; so one evening at supper,
surrounded by a gay and mixed company, when Mrs.<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_121"></a>[121]</span>
Corbett threw her gibe across at him, stung to revolt
and indiscretion, his temper suddenly boiled over,
and he exclaimed:</p>

<p>&#8220;Now look here, Lola, I&#8217;m just a bit tired of your
chaff&mdash;this joke is about played out. Miss Glyn,&#8221; and
he glared round the circle, &#8220;is the prettiest girl I
have ever seen&mdash;bar none&mdash;and I am going to marry
her! Here,&#8221; he added, &#8220;fill your glasses&mdash;I call upon
you to drink the health of the future Mrs. Blagdon!&#8221;</p>

<p>Sensation. To borrow an expression from legal cases
of a dramatic character.</p>

<p>Mrs. Corbett was speechless; leaving her champagne
untasted she exclaimed:</p>

<p>&#8220;But, Hugo, of course you are joking&mdash;why she is
only a child of seventeen&mdash;twenty years younger
than yourself! You must be out of your senses.
You,&#8221; and there was a challenge in her eye, &#8220;never
<i>could</i> be such a fool!&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Wait till you see,&#8221; he growled.</p>

<p>&#8220;Perhaps the lady won&#8217;t have you?&#8221; suggested one
of his fair friends with a malicious laugh.</p>

<p>&#8220;I don&#8217;t think there&#8217;s much doubt about <i>that</i>,&#8221;
declared the Baron, who was, however, consumed with
alarm by this sudden announcement; a bachelor
Blagdon was one thing, a married man with a very
pretty, and no doubt influential wife, was another&mdash;his
day was done! No more hundred-pound cheques
for him&mdash;no more big dressmaker&#8217;s bills for Mrs.
Corbett, no more long-tailed hunters for Lord Robbie;
all the same, there was no harm in hedging a bit.<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_122"></a>[122]</span>
The day after the supper party Blagdon abruptly
announced that he was going home. He had taken a
final turn along the terrace alone under the stars, and
assured himself, that these harpies were getting a bit
too much for him. They looked upon him as their
paymaster, and Lola was beyond all bounds&mdash;her bills
were really outrageous; she was too fond of cigarettes
and champagne; he had about enough of Monte Carlo,
and decided to cut the whole blooming show.</p>

<p>Before leaving for England he went over to Cannes
in order to interview his mother, and inform her that
he was about to get married.</p>

<p>&#8220;Married!&#8221; she exclaimed; &#8220;and to whom?&#8221;
She stiffened all over as she added, &#8220;I trust she is a
reputable person?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;<i>Rather.</i>&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Is it one of Lady Barron&#8217;s nieces?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;No, no,&#8221; with a gesture of indignant scorn; &#8220;someone
much younger and prettier. You know Mrs.
Fenchurch?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Very slightly,&#8221; she answered loftily.</p>

<p>&#8220;Well, it&#8217;s her niece.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;What&mdash;that little Miss Glyn?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Ye-es; but she&#8217;s not so little, a good five foot
seven.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;But, my dear Hugo, I understand she&#8217;s only a
schoolgirl.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;She&#8217;s past seventeen&mdash;everyone doesn&#8217;t marry
when they are middle-aged&#8221; (an unfilial rap at his
mother). &#8220;She is awfully pretty; extraordinarily good-looking,<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_123"></a>[123]</span>
I may say, and accomplished. I heard her
playing and singing at the Bonhams&#8217;, and I tell you she
astonished them.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;And you astonish me! She is far too young.
What you want, Hugo, is a handsome, clever, well-bred
girl, who has been about the world a bit, who will be
able to manage a big establishment, and take her
proper place in the County.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Thank you, I know that sort! but they wouldn&#8217;t
suit me. I&#8217;m not looking for a manageress, or a
housekeeper, what I want is a beauty who makes
everyone turn round, and stare at her.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Ah!&#8221; exclaimed Mrs. Blagdon, and she relapsed
into silence. Hugo&#8217;s choice might have been much
worse. To tell the truth, she had always anticipated
that a lady from the boards of the Jollity Theatre
would be her future daughter-in-law.</p>

<p>&#8220;And when is it to be?&#8221; she asked at last.</p>

<p>&#8220;I am going straight home now to propose for her.
I&#8217;ll get it fixed up as soon as the trousseau is in hand.
I&#8217;d like to spend May on the Italian lakes.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;You seem pretty sure of her, my dear Hugo.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I&#8217;m sure of her aunt, and that comes to the same
thing; the girl has never been allowed to have a will
of her own, and wouldn&#8217;t say boo to a goose.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I shouldn&#8217;t have thought that was your style.
However, I am thankful that your future wife will be a
<i>lady</i>. She has good blood in her veins, and no doubt
will develop; the one great drawback in my opinion
is, that she is too young.&#8221;</p>



<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_124"></a>[124]</span>&#8220;Well, there&#8217;s something in that, you know,&#8221; he
replied. &#8220;She has no past&mdash;hasn&#8217;t had time to have
one.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;No, and most of your lady friends have not one&mdash;but
half a dozen.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I suppose you won&#8217;t be home before June?&#8221;
ignoring this thrust.</p>

<p>&#8220;Oh, I will return for the wedding, of course. A
daughter-in-law is an important interest. You will
let me hear how things go, won&#8217;t you?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Yes, and I must be off now, as I&#8217;m leaving by the
evening train. Good-bye, old lady,&#8221; and he touched
her forehead with his lips, stepped out into the
verandah, and so disappeared.</p>

<p>Precisely a fortnight later, Mrs. Blagdon received
the following telegram:</p>

<p>&#8220;All settled, date May 20th, Hugo.&#8221;</p>
<hr class="chap x-ebookmaker-drop" />

<div class="chapter">
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_125"></a>[125]</span>

<h2 class="nobreak">CHAPTER XII</h2>
</div>


<p class="drop-cap">THE news in the telegram was authentic. Blagdon&#8217;s
determination and her aunt&#8217;s strong support,
had overborne Letty&#8217;s reluctance, and almost in
spite of herself, she was about to make what is called
&#8216;a great match.&#8217; When the suitor appeared at The
Holt, and laid his intentions and hopes before Mrs.
Fenchurch, it was with difficulty that the lady could
conceal her satisfaction. With suppressed emotion,
she assured her would-be nephew, that he had her own
and her husband&#8217;s warmest goodwill: to which he
rejoined with a nonchalant laugh:</p>

<p>&#8220;Oh yes&mdash;of course&mdash;that&#8217;s all right; but what
about Miss Glyn?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Letty is in absolute ignorance of her conquest,&#8221;
replied the lady with measured emphasis. &#8220;She is
only seventeen, very, very shy and innocent; if you
startle or frighten her, nothing on earth would induce
her to marry you. She is not worldly in any
sense, and all the splendid fairy tale things you can
bestow, will not appeal to her, as they would to
other girls.&#8221;</p>

<p>Blagdon made no reply; he was standing with his
back to the fire, looking down thoughtfully on his
irreproachable boots. Suddenly he raised his eyes and<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_126"></a>[126]</span>
fixed them on his companion, with an expression of
insolent incredulity.</p>

<p>&#8220;I think with a horse and a dog of her own, some
pretty frocks and a few young friends, Letty would be
contented and happy,&#8221; she continued with composure.
&#8220;Be very quiet with her at first, and allow the idea to
dawn upon her by degrees. I mean, the idea of becoming
your wife.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;How do you mean, dawn?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Well, if I may make a suggestion, suppose you put
up at Ridgefield and ride over to lunch occasionally;
I have a quiet mare I can lend Letty&mdash;my husband
will do gooseberry&mdash;do you see?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I <i>see</i>,&#8221; he nodded, &#8220;all right. Yes I&#8217;ll take your
tip. But look here, Mrs. Fenchurch, don&#8217;t let us
have a long engagement, and all that sort of
tomfoolery!&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;No, no, certainly not; happy is the wooing that&#8217;s
not long a-doing,&#8221; she quoted. &#8220;And now I&#8217;ll send
Letty to talk to you, and go and see if they are
bringing in tea.&#8221;</p>

<p>Blagdon accepted the chaperon&#8217;s advice, assuring
himself that Mrs. Fen was a clever woman, she should
run <i>this</i> part of the show; and accordingly, on various
pretexts, he was to be seen at The Holt, two or three
times a week.</p>

<p>He was really fond of the little girl. What colouring!
what hair! what lovely, innocent eyes! The magic
quality of her youth and freshness was indescribably
piquant to his jaded taste.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_127"></a>[127]</span>It was a fact that Letty&mdash;ever sensitive to her surroundings&mdash;had
in the present genial atmosphere unfolded
like an exquisite flower. Her aunt was a puzzle,
she was changed, and had become so thoughtful and
indulgent, and had actually lent her a beautiful mare
called &#8216;Mouse,&#8217; and every day, wet or fine, she and
her uncle openly and happily enjoyed long rides and
long, confidential conversations. Occasionally these
rides and conversations were shared by Mr. Blagdon,
who would drop in to lunch and join the party. Exercise
and April sunshine, brought smiles and radiance into the
girl&#8217;s face, and Blagdon was astonished to discover
how animated and gay Miss Glyn could be. How she
and her uncle chaffed one another; how many jokes
they shared. With respect to himself, her manner
was guarded&mdash;not to say distant; a supreme indifference
to his wealth and importance, enhanced her value
tenfold. Supposing&mdash;chilling thought&mdash;that in spite
of his boastful confidence, sweet seventeen were to
refuse him?</p>

<p>Pricked by this apprehension, Blagdon took, for
him, infinite pains to please, and tuned his personality
in a lower key, more in harmony with that of his
companion; and exhibited the best side of his character&mdash;generosity,
a love of animals, a certain brusque
sincerity. He looked his best in the saddle, was
a bold and admirable horseman, and Miss Glyn began
to like him. He had made her a present of a fox
terrier, and was so good-natured, and not at all
grand <i>now</i>.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_128"></a>[128]</span>By sundry subtle indications, half a word, a quick
glance, Letty gathered that her new friend was <i>not</i>
one of her aunt&#8217;s disciples&mdash;indeed, rather the reverse!
Here was one strong, if secret, bond between them, a
rooted dislike of the same individual: and on this
slender foundation, did Letty Glyn venture to build
her home!</p>

<p>At first, when &#8216;the idea&#8217; presented itself to her
mind&mdash;the idea, that Mr. Blagdon wished to marry
her&mdash;she thrust it from her in dismay. This was not
the husband she looked for, when, with her face buried
in the counterpane, she had made to herself a sobbing,
smothered, vow. And yet, whispered the persistent
&#8216;idea,&#8217; he was kind, and he was strong; he would give
her a home of her own, and protect her from Aunt
Dorothy! And Aunt Dorothy was so bent upon this
marriage. The girl shivered as she thought of her
future, if her tyrant were disappointed! Poor
Uncle Tom did not count; truth held before her, the
remorseless fact, that she had to choose between her
aunt, and Mr. Blagdon&mdash;Which was it to be?</p>

<p>Naturally Mrs. Fenchurch had enlarged upon Blagdon&#8217;s
position and wealth; when she spoke of Sharsley
and its splendours she became positively eloquent.</p>

<p>&#8220;The Scrope heirlooms, my dear child, are worth a
fortune, and beyond the reach of American dollars.
Old Scrope made them over with the place; the miniatures
are marvellous, and there are two Nankin jars
there that a Chinaman would worship on his knees!
If Hugo asks you to marry him, Letty, you will be the<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_129"></a>[129]</span>
luckiest girl in England! Has he said anything?&#8221; she
enquired after a moment&#8217;s silence.</p>

<p>&#8220;No,&#8221; faltered the victim, with scarlet cheeks.
&#8220;Nothing.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;<i>What?</i>&#8221; The question was like a bullet.</p>

<p>&#8220;But I&mdash;I&mdash;I think he wishes to, Aunt Dorothy.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Then let him speak, for Heaven&#8217;s sake!&#8221; urged
Mrs. Fenchurch with authoritative emphasis.</p>

<p>&#8220;Do remember, my dear, that you have only your
little pension, and if anything were to happen to your
uncle,&#8221; she paused expressively, leaving the question
to be answered by the imagination of her companion.</p>

<p>One morning shortly after this conversation, Letty
found herself in the drawing-room alone with Blagdon,
and he spoke.</p>

<p>&#8220;Look here, Miss Glyn,&#8221; he began abruptly, &#8220;I&#8217;m
no good at beating about the bush.&#8221;</p>

<p>Letty glanced up at him interrogatively. She was
sitting in the window, knitting golf stockings for her
uncle.</p>

<p>&#8220;You can bet it&#8217;s not to see your aunt I&#8217;ve been
coming over here, eh? It&#8217;s to see <i>you</i>!&#8221;</p>

<p>Letty looked down: her fingers were shaking visibly.</p>

<p>&#8220;I am older than you, and all that sort of thing,&#8221;
he continued airily; &#8220;but I&#8217;m not a bad sort, as my
sister can tell you, and I want to know if you will
marry me. Come now, don&#8217;t turn away like that, if
it&#8217;s going to be &#8216;yes.&#8217; Give me your hand.&#8221;</p>

<p>Suddenly she heard her aunt&#8217;s voice in the hall; it
sounded unusually sharp, and dictatorial, and in a<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_130"></a>[130]</span>
panic of terror, Letty extended a cold, limp little hand,
on which Blagdon instantly imprinted a lingering, and
burning kiss.</p>

<p>Then the door-handle turned noisily to admit Mrs.
Fenchurch, and her newly pledged niece rose hastily
to her feet, and all but ran out of the room.</p>

<p>Dorothy Fenchurch sat late that night, writing her
great news on her best crested paper, to all her most
important correspondents. She and Hugo, as she now
called him, had had a talk: the wedding could take
place soon&mdash;there was really nothing to wait for. Tom
Fenchurch was, of course, brought into the consultation:
he had lately begun to think that Blagdon was
not such a bad sort, and that Letty might make something
of him, after all&mdash;though down in his heart he
did not approve of the match; but who could withstand
Dorothy? Now, as he took part in and listened
to this discussion, his contribution consisted of the
words, repeated over and over again:</p>

<p>&#8220;Too young, too young; the child is too young;
much too young.&#8221; But it was as the voice of one
crying in a wilderness, Tom Fenchurch was in the
minority, the vote for an early wedding was easily
carried, and a notice to <i>The Morning Post</i> to that
effect, clinched the business.</p>

<p>Telegrams and letters poured in upon clever Mrs.
Fen: congratulating her upon this, her most glorious
achievement; not only was she the best housekeeper,
the best gardener, the best judge of old furniture
in the land, she had now crowned all her successes<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_131"></a>[131]</span>
by marrying her niece to the greatest <i>parti</i> in the
County!</p>

<p>Naturally there were some spiteful and envious detractors,
and one or two disappointed matrons shook
their heads, and confided to their friends that, &#8220;They
were <i>sorry</i> for the poor little girl.&#8221;</p>

<p>The trousseau engrossed a good deal of time. Mrs.
Fenchurch and her niece made many trips to London
for shopping and fittings&mdash;fashionable frocks, far, far
beyond the ability, but not the ambition, of Mrs.
Cope.</p>

<p>Owing to these absences, and Blagdon&#8217;s own engagements,
the happy pair did not see much of one
another. Once or twice he came over and stayed at
The Holt for a week-end, bringing wonderful offerings
for his fianc&eacute;e. He was absurdly proud of Letty, but
surprisingly discreet and thoughtful. Colonel Tom
assured his quaking heart, that the match might turn
out all right after all! His wife had no fears.</p>

<p>Letty noticed, with grateful surprise, how extremely
kind and friendly everyone had become; people to
whom she was almost a stranger, and various far-away
and important visitors, came to The Holt, talked
to her with unaffected interest, and gazed at her
curiously. One and all, offered their warmest congratulations,
and declared that they would call as soon
as ever she was settled at Sharsley.</p>

<p>But Mrs. Hesketh was discontented&mdash;her normal
attitude&mdash;she refused to be reasoned with, overpowered
with grandeur or talked down. Her own<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_132"></a>[132]</span>
married life had not been happy, and the first time
she was alone with Letty she said:</p>

<p>&#8220;My dear child, of course I congratulate you, and
I wish you all happiness; but have you thoroughly
made up your mind? You do not know the world
yet; you have no idea what marriage means; and
you are so diffident, and unassertive. I think that the
post of wife to Mr. Blagdon is too <i>big</i> for you!&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I&#8217;m afraid in some ways it is,&#8221; she assented. &#8220;I
am not accustomed to money. The most I have ever
had to spend as I chose, was the ten pounds Uncle
Tom gave me last Christmas. Still, I think Mr. Blagdon
and I will get on together; he is so kind, he brings
me the most lovely flowers and jewels, and says that
once I am married to him, I shall do exactly as I
please.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I wonder what you will please to do?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I will try to please <i>him</i>, and set about learning ever
so many things&mdash;to ride well&mdash;to talk amusingly&mdash;and&mdash;&mdash;&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;It is not so easy to ride well, and talk amusingly,&#8221;
Mrs. Hesketh quickly interposed. &#8220;Such things come
by nature. Now shall I give you a little advice?
Do not make confidantes of anyone in a hurry&mdash;be
yourself, and keep to yourself till you know a little
more of life and do not expect too much; remember
that marriage is a blessing to few, a curse to many,
and a great uncertainty to all.&#8221;</p>

<p>Letty broke into a merry laugh.</p>

<p>&#8220;Well, you <i>are</i> a Job&#8217;s comforter!&#8221;</p>



<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_133"></a>[133]</span>&#8220;Never <i>over</i>-exert yourself to please; your husband&#8217;s
imagination may endow you with great gifts.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;And when I am found to be merely a silly, inexperienced
little chit of seventeen?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Oh, experience will come fast enough. I want you
to promise me one thing.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I will promise you anything you like,&#8221; said Letty
recklessly.</p>

<p>&#8220;Then if you are in any trouble or difficulty come
to <i>me</i>&mdash;whatever you tell me, will be sacred, and as
an old stager, if I may call myself so, I can advise
you what to do, and what not to do.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I can promise you this with all my heart, and I
would a thousand times rather come to you than to
Aunt Dorothy,&#8221; and her delicate lips trembled. &#8220;She
has always been so cold to me.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Well, at any rate, she is immensely proud of you
now, my dear. You know she is a typical, strong-willed
sort of person, who lies awake at night thinking of what
is for everyone&#8217;s good. She cannot concentrate on <i>one</i>
individual.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Yes, and at present she is thinking day and night
about the wedding preparations: Uncle has given two
hundred pounds to spend on my trousseau, and aunt is
choosing it; but I have been allowed to have a say in
my wedding dress. I&#8217;m sure I don&#8217;t know how we
shall squeeze all the congregation into the church.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;You have seen your mother-in-law, have you not?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I spent a day with her in London&mdash;she is rather
a formidable old lady with a long, white face, a<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_134"></a>[134]</span>
straight back, and beautiful hands. I cannot imagine
her being Hugo&#8217;s mother&mdash;she is so unlike him, but I
feel sure that she means to be kind: she gave me a most
beautiful lace veil, and a set of opals and diamonds,
and by and by, when we return from the honeymoon,
she is coming down to stay with us. Hugo says that
I&#8217;m bound to like her in time&mdash;and that her bark is
worse than her bite.&#8221;</p>

<p>On her way from Oldcourt, Letty called to see her
friend, the Rector&#8217;s wife. Mrs. Denton had received
that morning a letter from her nephew Lancelot&mdash;who
was still stationed at Aldershot&mdash;which said:</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>&#8220;What is this that I hear about Miss Glyn and
Blagdon? Is it true that they are <i>engaged</i>? Oh, my
dear aunt, I believe that Miss Glyn is fond of you, and
if you could possibly give her a word of warning, it
would save her from the most frightful leap in the dark
a girl has ever taken. Blagdon will tire of her within
six months, and bully her for the rest of his days.
People at home don&#8217;t know the sort of fellow he is elsewhere,
and it is shameful for the Fenchurchs to allow
him to marry their niece. I know Mrs. Fen; she will
enjoy the glory of a great match, and that poor little
girl will be led like a lamb to the slaughter. Can&#8217;t <i>you</i>
do something? You will think I&#8217;m gone off my chump,
and am writing like a raving idiot, but I feel crazy, and
it is no secret to you, dear, clear-sighted auntie, that
I&#8217;m awfully fond of Letty myself. It&#8217;s bad enough
that she should marry at all&mdash;a regular facer for<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_135"></a>[135]</span>
me&mdash;but that she should marry this ruffian, is too
awful!&#8221;</p></div>

<p>When the bride-elect, all smiles and blushes, ran in
to tell Mrs. Denton about the kind letters, and the
lovely presents, she had received, and how her train
was to be of white satin, and she was to have two pages,
the poor lady had this explosive missive under her
pillow. Yet she dare not allude to it; her courage
failed her, she could not utter the necessary word.
Already she had thrown cold water on one love affair,
and how was she to defy Mrs. Fenchurch, and dash
her splendid project to the ground? She only said:</p>

<p>&#8220;Dear Letty, you are so young to marry! I do wish
you could have waited a year, and seen a little more
of the world.&#8221; There were tears in her eyes, as she
added: &#8220;The great thing that is necessary, at any
rate during the first year of married life, is forbearance.
Everyone is on their best behaviour during their
engagement, and afterwards&mdash;so many little things
come out&mdash;things that surprise one. I wonder if you
realise the solemn vow, &#8216;Till death us do part,&#8217;
marriage is such a serious step.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;But it cannot be anything so very dreadful,&#8221; objected
Letty. &#8220;I know so many married people, and
they don&#8217;t look a bit different to the rest of the world.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Well, dear child, I pray that you may be truly
happy in your new home, and remember, you will
always have a loving friend in me.&#8221;</p>

<p>What did these two ladies, Mrs. Denton and Mrs.
Hesketh, mean by impressing upon her the fact, that<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_136"></a>[136]</span>
they were her friends? Why did Mrs. Denton cry?
What could happen? Once or twice a certain trembling
shook the bride-elect; a nervousness, in the face
of the unknown; but this was a mere passing tremor:
and crafty and vigilant Mrs. Fenchurch contrived, that
Letty was left little time for solitude or reflection.</p>

<p>Three weeks later the wedding took place. It was a
beautiful May day, the whole village was <i>en f&ecirc;te</i>, the
bride looked lovely&mdash;this was the truth, no mere conventional
statement; the bride&#8217;s aunt wore blue
velvet, bird of paradise plumes, and an expression of
radiant triumph. Everything went off with great
&eacute;clat, and a carriage with four horses whirled away the
happy pair, upon the first stage of their honeymoon.</p>
<hr class="chap x-ebookmaker-drop" />

<div class="chapter">
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_137"></a>[137]</span>

<h2 class="nobreak">CHAPTER XIII</h2>
</div>


<p class="drop-cap">THE honeymoon&mdash;a not uncommon experience&mdash;proved
more or less of a disappointment to the
wedded pair. The bride, dazed and confounded by
her new status, and the change from a nobody to a
personage, was shy and silent, and felt herself to be a
mere lay figure in the hands of her maid&mdash;a sour-faced,
phlegmatic person with an inflated idea of her own importance,
and more or less incompetent.</p>

<p>Tucker had been engaged by Mrs. Fenchurch, to
whom she was warmly recommended by an acquaintance;
a deceitful lady who was only too delighted to be
rid of her encumbrance.</p>

<p>The trousseau&mdash;also selected by Mrs. Fenchurch&mdash;was
even less satisfactory than the maid; it was old-fashioned
and dowdy; more suitable to a matron of
fifty, than a girl of seventeen.</p>

<p>Unfortunately the weather on the Blue Lakes was
wet, and it is pitiful to relate that after a fortnight his
bride had begun to bore Blagdon; already he was
tired of his experiment, Letty was so hopelessly young,
timid, and ignorant; they had hardly any interests in
common, and there was a difference of twenty long
years yawning between their ages. Blagdon&#8217;s experience
of life being wide and highly illustrated,<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_138"></a>[138]</span>
whilst the girl had seen nothing of the world, beyond
a school-room, and The Holt.</p>

<p>As for her beauty, here again was a grievance! The
bride could not endure the admiration of her fellow
guests; but shrank into corners, disappeared into
lobbies, or slinked away to the seclusion of her private
sitting-room. Her husband&#8217;s vast fortune made no
appeal to Letty; lavish outlay of money, gorgeous
suites of apartments, reserved railway carriages, and a
retinue of servants, merely filled her with embarrassment
and alarm, and she went in abject terror of her
maid; Mrs. Blagdon was a tame, shrinking, remote
sort of creature, who took nothing on herself, and
yielded her husband a sort of childish and pathetic
obedience. Hugo was naturally something of a bully,
and the more the girl submitted to his orders and
caprices, the more he encroached.</p>

<p>The happy pair stayed at Caddenabia on Como, and
then moved on to Baveno on Maggiore; here they
boated, went for drives, and enjoyed their <i>t&ecirc;te-&agrave;-t&ecirc;te</i>
meals in solitary dignity, and here, alas! the sole company
of his wife palled upon Blagdon. What topics had
they in common? How could he talk to a girl who had
never been to a play, or to a race meeting, had never
read a naughty book, or heard even a whisper of
notorious scandals? He soon found his way to the
billiard and smoking-rooms, and during two hopelessly
wet days, when there was a lack of English papers and
appreciative society, his bad humour, undisguised and
unashamed, was vented on his valet and Letty. To<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_139"></a>[139]</span>
the hardened servant, a rating was as the proverbial
water running off a duck&#8217;s back! but to the unaccustomed
and trembling girl, it proved a terrible awakening.
One evening, the condescending Miss Tucker was
surprised to find her mistress crouched at her bedroom
window the impersonation of misery and despair. &#8220;So
they had had a falling out already! Well, it <i>was</i> early
days.&#8221;</p>

<p>In spite of prolonged bathing of her eyes, and a justifiable
amount of powder, there were still traces of recent
trouble when the bride appeared at dinner. Fortunately
the newspapers had arrived, and during the meal
her husband&mdash;to the astonishment of polite Italian
waiters&mdash;read them at intervals between the courses;
whilst his companion sat opposite, with dry lips, and a
deadly sickness at her heart.</p>

<p>The following morning Blagdon abruptly announced
that &#8220;he had had enough of loafing, and it was time to
set their faces towards home.&#8221; On their way thither,
they stopped in Paris, and put up at the H&ocirc;tel Riche,
and here, to Hugo&#8217;s joy, he encountered Sir Billy
and Lady Slater, Mrs. Freddy Corbett, and Lord
Robbie; a loud-voiced, cheery quartette, who were
returning tardily from Monte Carlo. He presented
them to his wife, and subsequently entertained
them at a magnificent dinner, at which the bride
presided.</p>

<p>Poor girl! she was hopelessly out of her element;
although she did her utmost to conceal her embarrassment,
and talk and identify herself with these, her<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_140"></a>[140]</span>
first guests. For their part, the company were dumbfounded
by her youth and simplicity, her shyness, and
pathetic ignorance of Life.</p>

<p>Oh, she was pretty enough, they agreed; there was
no mistake about her looks and air of breeding; but
she was not the &#8216;right sort of wife for Blag!&#8217; No, he
had backed the wrong one this time, &#8220;made a bad
cast,&#8221; said Lord Robbie to himself, and as he glanced
from the host to the hostess, he seemed already to
catch sight of an impending disaster.</p>

<p>Somehow the girl&#8217;s clothes were not right, her hair
was badly dressed; what a contrast to Lola Corbett,
in her marvellous French frock, with her glittering
ornaments, and shameless shoulders. Lola was in great
form: talking incessantly, gay, provoking, challenging.
Of course, <i>she</i> was made up: but she took the centre
of the stage, and beside her brilliance and vivacity the
timid bride looked positively washed out, and dowdy.</p>

<p>The hostess failed to understand most of the good
stories, chaff, and repartee that circulated with the &#8217;84
champagne. She felt hopelessly stupid and bewildered,
when the company roared with laughter, and hammered
and thumped on the table&mdash;for the point of the anecdote,
or saying, had generally eluded her altogether.
Once, an unmistakably plain tale brought a flood of
scarlet into her face, and she looked so startled and
so shocked, that a not easily embarrassed party felt
momentarily abashed.</p>

<p>Mrs. Blagdon did not care for champagne, she preferred
lemonade! had never been to a music-hall, or<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_141"></a>[141]</span>
smoked in her life. This much Lord Robbie gathered,
as they rose and led the way into the grand lounge, with
its dazzling illuminations, mighty palms, and seductive
seats; its admirable orchestra and festive company.</p>

<p>Here, the party soon discovered a comfortable
corner, and whilst the men selected cigars and liqueurs
and discussed an important handicap, the two lady
guests sank into deep fauteuils&mdash;one on either side
of their hostess, and began, with clever probing questions,
to examine her respecting her tour, her plans,
her tastes, whilst all the time they surveyed her with
hard and critical eyes. Nothing escaped their inspection,
from the little mean aigrette in her ill-dressed
hair, to the tip of her satin shoe.</p>

<p>Round her slender throat was a diamond collet,
its emerald pendants presenting a charming contrast
with a snow-white neck. Mrs. Corbett instantly recognised
her long and vainly coveted ornament, and her
glance gleamed. So here, was the Monte Carlo necklace,
by rights her possession, bestowed on this little
milk-and-water school miss! and she instantly made
up her mind to retrieve the treasure, on an appropriate
opportunity.</p>

<p>And if her husband&#8217;s friends were disappointed in
his bride, it was no less true, that they had made an
unpleasant impression on her. She shrank in secret
consternation from the men&#8217;s bold glances, questioning
eyes, and reckless talk; and from these two
painted women&mdash;with their insufferable patronage,
and familiarity.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_142"></a>[142]</span>&#8220;Of course, we must call you Letty,&#8221; had been one
of Lady Slater&#8217;s first announcements. &#8220;I am Tatty,
Mrs. Corbett is Lola. You see we are such <i>very</i> old
pals of your husband&#8217;s, we couldn&#8217;t call him Hugo,
and you Mrs. Blagdon, could we?&#8221;</p>

<p>What strange eyes they had! blacked all round,
and so piercing and defiant; and how they reeked of
some heavy Oriental perfume. As for their splendid
gowns, it made Letty nervous to contemplate the
fragile shoulder straps, that held the corsage from
slipping into space.</p>

<p>Mrs. Corbett wore a wonderful flame-coloured garment,
touched with glimpses of gold tissue, and pale
blue chiffon; a diamond bow sparkled in her dark
hair, and a long chain of pearls dangled to her waist.
Lady Slater affected a more massive style; lounging
in a Berg&eacute;re, with a cigarette between her lips and her
knees crossed, she gave a generous exhibition of pink
silk stocking, with black &#8216;clocks&#8217; and a pair of fairly
large gold shoes. There had been a good deal of chaff
about Lady Slater&#8217;s stockings; it appeared that she
had recently won a dozen pair, in a bet with Lord
Robbie.</p>

<p>Turning to Letty she explained:</p>

<p>&#8220;The bet was about you, my dear! though I&#8217;m not
going to tell you what it <i>was</i>,&#8221; and she gave a loud and
disconcerting &#8216;Ha! ha! ha!&#8217;</p>

<p>&#8220;But of course you&#8217;ll tell <i>me</i>, Tatty,&#8221; began Mrs.
Corbett. &#8220;Good Lord! what&#8217;s this?&#8221; and she sat
erect. &#8220;Upon my word! Do you see?&#8221;</p>



<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_143"></a>[143]</span>They looked; a tall, bold, amazingly handsome
woman had entered, accompanied by two men; and
paused in dramatic prominence as if to challenge attention.
The effect was arresting. This new arrival
was ablaze with diamonds&mdash;an audacious nudity but
partly concealed by ropes of pearls. Her dress was
exactly similar to the one worn by Mrs. Corbett.</p>

<p>&#8220;My hat!&#8221; exclaimed Lord Robbie.</p>

<p>&#8220;Who is she?&#8221; whispered Letty.</p>

<p>&#8220;Amora, the actress, the most notorious woman in
Paris. I say, Lola,&#8221; turning to her with a grin, &#8220;here&#8217;s
your <i>twin</i>!&#8221;</p>

<p>At this moment, Amora, impersonation of wealth
and wickedness, swept by, casting as she passed, a
glance of withering scorn upon her duplicate; their
eyes met with a shock, and blazed as two flames.</p>

<p>&#8220;Tartare told me on her oath that mine was the
exclusive model,&#8221; began Mrs. Corbett, a little breathlessly,
as soon as she had recovered her composure.
She still looked alarmingly furious as she added, &#8220;I
paid her three thousand francs for this rag, and she
has gone and made a copy for that devil!&#8221; In her
excitement she had raised her voice&mdash;people were
staring; as Blagdon and Sir Billy turned about, she
paused, and muttered to herself in a manner that
boded ill for Madame Tartare!</p>

<p>Lady Slater now rose and beckoned to Hugo.</p>

<p>&#8220;Come over to this settee,&#8221; she said; &#8220;there is just
room for two little people&mdash;and have a flirtation with
<i>me</i>.&#8221;</p>



<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_144"></a>[144]</span>Blagdon assented obediently, and as she seated herself
she continued:</p>

<p>&#8220;It was only an excuse to tell you that I think your
little girl is just too sweet for anything!&#8221;</p>

<p>He nodded with stolid complacency.</p>

<p>&#8220;But she wants a lot of what we sporting folk call
&#8216;handling.&#8217; She&#8217;s a bit nervous at the post&mdash;and a
shocking bad starter.&#8221;</p>

<p>Again Blagdon nodded, but on this occasion without
complacence.</p>

<p>&#8220;The child has lovely eyes&mdash;eyes like some beautiful
wild filly, that is ready to bolt. She is as pretty as a
picture, but she is too young! My dear man, why
doesn&#8217;t she get a woman who can do her hair? And
where <i>did</i> she pick up those early Victorian garments?
She doesn&#8217;t give herself half a chance!&#8221;</p>

<p>Blagdon glared into the artistically painted face of
his companion.</p>

<p>&#8220;As you say, she is too young,&#8221; he growled savagely;
&#8220;give her time&mdash;in twenty years she&#8217;ll be up to all
the tricks of the trade!&#8221;</p>

<p>Hugo was secretly furious with his old associates;
they had not shown half enough enthusiasm; with
regard to his bride, their congratulations had been
tepid. He had expected them to figuratively prostrate
themselves, and worship the girl he had delighted to
honour; and as for the outer world, he anticipated
that they would crane their necks, or even mount on
chairs (as in the case of a renowned beauty) in order
to catch sight of the famous Mrs. Blagdon!</p>



<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_145"></a>[145]</span>He stared over at Letty, seated a little aloof from
Lola and Lord Robbie,&mdash;who had now been joined by
two vivacious ladies, and a man resembling a brigand
chief. Yes, she certainly <i>was</i> a bit out of the picture,
among these well-dressed, well-corseted, animated
women; there was no liqueur glass by her, no cigarette
between her lips, her hands were tightly clasped in her
lap, and she looked for all her lovely face, forlorn and
badly dressed,&mdash;the picture of conscious insignificance.
Her attitude, too, not lounging in careless ease, but
cramped up, with her feet tucked under her chair, suggested
a fear of mice. There were no mice in this
magnificent lounge. The truth he could divine. Letty
was afraid of her guests&mdash;a pretty condition for a
hostess!</p>

<p>Lady Slater&#8217;s criticisms were not thrown away; for
the following day, the amazed and indignant Tucker
received her wages and her <i>cong&eacute;</i>. Mrs. Corbett had,
for her part, kindly undertaken to find a good French
maid, also to help Letty to select several really fashionable
hats and gowns.</p>

<p>&#8220;For goodness&#8217; sake get her something she can be
seen in,&#8221; urged Blagdon; &#8220;frocks that will make
all the neighbours open their eyes&mdash;<i>le dernier cri</i>&mdash;and
that sort of thing, real smart. Money no object!&#8221;</p>

<p>As the atelier of Madame Tartare was close to their
hotel, the two ladies proceeded thither on foot. They
were received by a dignified man-servant, and conducted
up a great staircase into a lofty suite of rooms,
carpeted with moss-green Axminster, and lined with long<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_146"></a>[146]</span>
mirrors and presses. After a moment&#8217;s delay, Madame
appeared, a middle-aged woman with a clever face and
a marvellously fitting gown: all gracious exclamations
and gestures of welcome, until she realised that her
ch&egrave;re Madame Corbett had come not in peace, but in
war!</p>

<p>As Letty listened to her companion&#8217;s denunciations,
she felt terrified; never had she assisted at such a
scene, or beheld anyone make such an absolute surrender
to fury. What a frantic temper, who could
withstand it? How could anyone cope with such
violent vituperation, such frenzied threats? She felt
half inclined to creep out of sight, and hide herself in
one of the great wardrobes.</p>

<p>Meanwhile Mrs. Corbett figuratively brandishing the
copied gown, raged and stormed: in voluble French
she rent the discomfited dressmaker, who presently
finding spirit and speech, in ten times more fluent
language, poured forth her plausible apologies. The
uproar was such, that milliners and <i>mannequins</i>
assembled at a discreet distance, in order to hear and
to see.</p>

<p>&#8220;<i>Tiens! c&#8217;&eacute;tait Madame Cor&mdash;bett&mdash;quelle femme!</i>&#8221;</p>

<p>After a time the battle waned, the fury of the customer
abated. She had gained her point, the <i>gown was
to be taken back</i>!</p>

<p>Deceitful Tartare, believing Madame had departed
for England, had ventured to make several copies of
what was termed &#8220;La Robe Odalisque.&#8221;</p>

<p>When peace was proclaimed, having recovered<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_147"></a>[147]</span>
breath and composure, the victor commanded a display
of hats and gowns; these were promptly and
politely exhibited, and three costumes were selected
by Mrs. Corbett&mdash;whose taste was for the flamboyant
and bizarre. She also set aside several hats and a tea-gown;
and before Letty could protest, or interfere, she
found herself fitted out in what ecstatic Madame declared
to be &#8216;<i>tous ce qu&#8217;il y a de plus ravissante et plus
chic!</i>&#8217; and added that as the young lady had &#8216;a stock
figure,&#8217; all the robes would be ready in a few hours.</p>

<p>Now that his wife was provided with a suitable maid,
and smart outfit, Blagdon saw no reason to postpone
his journey, and he and Letty (wearing a most amazing
toque) took their departure for London.</p>

<p>As the train moved away from the platform of
&#8216;Le Nord,&#8217; Lady Slater turned to her companion, and
repeated:</p>

<p>&#8220;See us at Sharsley for the hunting&mdash;you <i>bet</i> he
will! My dear Lola, you have made the poor child a
figure of fun&mdash;that toque is the sort of thing a lunatic
would make&mdash;and wear!&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Well, yes, it&#8217;s a little <i>outr&eacute;</i>&mdash;one of Tartare&#8217;s
latest,&#8221; and she laughed maliciously.</p>

<p>&#8220;I wonder Letty did not kick!&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Oh, she&#8217;s only a child&mdash;a simpleton!&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;And looks pretty in anything&mdash;that&#8217;s the <i>worst</i> of
her, eh?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Her looks are a matter of opinion,&#8221; declared Mrs.
Corbett stiffly. &#8220;I can&#8217;t say that <i>I</i> admire chocolate-box
profiles; and I can tell you one thing&mdash;though you<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_148"></a>[148]</span>
may have seen it for yourself, my clever Tatty&mdash;our
beloved Blag is <i>deadly</i> sick of the girl already.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Ah, well, poor thing, I can&#8217;t help feeling sorry for
her; she&#8217;s too heavily handicapped.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Bah!&#8221; exclaimed Mrs. Corbett, &#8220;she&#8217;s out of her
place altogether. She ought to have married an
evangelical curate.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Not up to form, eh?&#8221; suggested her ladyship,
then muttered, &#8220;and anyway, <i>you</i> intend to ride her
off the course,&#8221; and with this prudently suppressed
opinion, she led the way out of the station.</p>
<hr class="chap x-ebookmaker-drop" />

<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_149"></a>[149]</span>

<h2 class="nobreak">CHAPTER XIV</h2>
</div>


<p class="drop-cap">ON arrival in London the newly married couple
established themselves at Claridge&#8217;s; Blagdon
accompanied his wife to the Opera and to Hurlingham,
gave smart dinners, and introduced her to his friends;
many of his mother&#8217;s connections called upon her, and
prepared to entertain them; but the bride suddenly became
indisposed, was confined to her room, and totally
unpresentable. The unfortunate victim had been
seized upon by that contemptible ailment known as the
mumps.</p>

<p>At last Mr. and Mrs. Blagdon appeared at Sharsley, and
met with a flattering reception. There were speeches,
a deputation, arches in the village, and a troop of the
local yeomanry escorted them from the station.
Sharsley Court, the ancestral home of the Scropes
(who with various family vicissitudes had lived there
since the reign of Henry VIII), was a noble Tudor
mansion, wisely enlarged by various owners, who were
proud of its fame. Sharsley village lay just outside
its beautiful old iron gates; the ancient, irregular
houses collected at either side of a wide street, or square,
were of rusty red brick, or black and white. A venerable
inn, furnished with wonderful treasures, attracted
no attention,&mdash;as the curio-collecting age had not yet<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_150"></a>[150]</span>
dawned, and many valuable bits to be found in the
village and neighbourhood were not merely neglected,
but actually despised. At the opposite end, facing the
gates of the Court, stood the church, a late Norman,
and near it, sheltered by giant elm trees, was a fine
old Jacobean Rectory.</p>

<p>Sharsley was four miles from a market town, seven
from a railway, and in those pre-motor days, a good
deal isolated and out of touch with the busy roaring
world. The Court itself had been built, as was the
fashion in old times, within a few hundred yards from
the entrance,&mdash;similar to Hatfield and Harwicke,&mdash;instead
of being situated in the midst of a vast park; but
the park existed, stretching far away on three sides,
and surrounded by a high wall.</p>

<p>Here and there this wall was broken by a space
filled in with iron railings, in order to give the residents
a more extended prospect, and envious passers-by
could, if they so pleased, from some of these openings,
enjoy an uninterrupted view of the mansion, with its
great terraced front. Later on, many wayfarers would
pause to stare at a small, solitary figure slowly pacing
to and fro, to and fro, to and fro, for all the world like
a wild thing in a cage. It was the young wife.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>But we are travelling too fast; the young wife has
barely crossed the threshold of her new home. To
her, it looked almost formidable, so cold and forbidding,
the great suite of reception rooms, the palatial staircase,<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_151"></a>[151]</span>
the circle of silent, impassive servants, all struck
terror into her youthful heart.</p>

<p>However it was midsummer, and the gardens and
grounds&mdash;recently put in order&mdash;were at their best,
the sun was shining, and she was not yet eighteen. By
degrees, the new mistress found her way through her
dominions. She had an interview with Mrs. Bates, the
housekeeper, gave a few orders respecting the arrangement
of her own boudoir, unpacked the wedding
presents, the little odds and ends they had collected
abroad, and arranged flowers and plants with such
notable success, that her lord and master grudgingly
exclaimed:</p>

<p>&#8220;Well, anyway, there is <i>one</i> thing you can do, Letty&mdash;you
can make a room look all right. I wish you could
do the same for yourself. Can&#8217;t you get that woman
to fix you up like other people? And for God&#8217;s sake
don&#8217;t let me ever see that blue garment again!&#8221;</p>

<p>The blue dress was one of the trousseau selected by
Mrs. Fenchurch,&mdash;who liked bright colours, heavy
materials, and lots of trimming.</p>

<p>&#8220;Would you rather that I wore white, Hugo?&#8221; she
asked with a pale propitiatory smile.</p>

<p>&#8220;Oh, well&mdash;wear what you like,&#8221; he rejoined impatiently,
&#8220;only don&#8217;t look a hideous dowdy&mdash;and
don&#8217;t bother <i>me</i>.&#8221;</p>

<p>And they had only been married six weeks.</p>

<p>&#8220;My mother is coming down, and she,&#8221; producing
a letter, &#8220;suggests a family house-party. These
Scropes are all for family and connections&mdash;such rot!<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_152"></a>[152]</span>
Here&#8217;s what she says&mdash;um&mdash;um&mdash;um: &#8216;Give Letty a
good start.&#8217; Ha! ha! &#8216;My cousin Louisa Calthorpe
and Calthorpe&#8217;&mdash;he&#8217;s an old stick-in-the-mud, and
lives the other end of the County&mdash;&#8216;Lord and Lady
Belford if at home; I&#8217;m sure they&#8217;d go for a couple
of nights; the Bishop, and your cousin Agatha
Mostyn.&#8217; The Bishop is as starched as they make &#8217;em,
and rampant on divorce and gambling, for all his
cordial manner. &#8216;Cyril Vernon and Lady Hilda.&#8217;
He&#8217;s our M.F.H.&mdash;not a bad sort&mdash;but the hunt horses
are a scandal; he buys all sorts of old crocks only fit
for the kennel. &#8216;Harding Grant, the County Member,
and his wife.&#8217; He&#8217;s a dull dog, always talking of the
&#8216;House.&#8217; That&#8217;s the lot&mdash;they are mostly connections.
How many&mdash;ten, eh? My mother and her companion,
Miss Hope, twelve. The house has forty-five bedrooms,
and we may as well fill some more. I suppose
I must ask the Fenchurchs, eh? From Friday till
Monday, so that they can&#8217;t stay on. By George, I bar
your aunt! I&#8217;ll never forget her on the wedding day.
You&#8217;d think she was going to be married herself. The
Calthorpe&#8217;s son, a naval man, is at home, and I believe
the Bishop has a daughter. We&#8217;d better stick them in,
and as for neighbours, the Rectory can come.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;And your sister?&#8221; suggested Letty.</p>

<p>&#8220;Oh Lord, no! This sort of party would not be
her form. Con would give them fits, and they
would bore her stiff! This is the duty lot, that&#8217;s to
give you a start, eh! Most of them have family
prayers, and go to bed at ten o&#8217;clock. Later, I&#8217;ll<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_153"></a>[153]</span>
have my own pals down, and they will keep the
place lively. My mother&#8217;s set are infernally dull.&#8221;</p>

<p>This was not an auspicious preparation, for a
nervous bride, and her first house-party.</p>

<p>&#8220;Now look here, don&#8217;t <i>you</i> attempt to do anything,&#8221;
he continued authoritatively; &#8220;leave all to Bates,
the housekeeper. She&#8217;s got to run the establishment,
that&#8217;s her job and what she&#8217;s paid for&mdash;she manages
the servants, and engages and dismisses them, orders
the meals, pays the tradespeople&mdash;so you have
absolutely nothing to do but to sit tight, and make
yourself agreeable.&#8221;</p>

<p>The guests duly arrived; arrangements for their
reception were complete, the best state bedrooms were
open, the choicest greenhouse flowers were brought
into the house, the silver service was displayed, everything
was perfectly done, there was no hitch.</p>

<p>Mrs. Fenchurch, brimming over with importance
and curiosity, embraced her dearest Letty with well-assumed
effusion. The Dowager Mrs. Blagdon merely
gave her daughter-in-law a frozen kiss, and requested
to be conducted to her room.</p>

<p>The company assembled that night in the white
drawing-room, was composed of the &#8216;dull&#8217; people,
with reposeful manners, who knew one another more
or less intimately; several were closely related, and
the women called one another by their Christian
names. There was no loud, hilarious laughing, no
rouge, no cigarette cases; the Dowager Mrs. Blagdon
was majestic in velvet and old lace, Mrs. Fenchurch<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_154"></a>[154]</span>
wore a hideous green costume, Lady Gaythorne, a too
well-known black brocade. The most conspicuous
figure on the occasion was the hostess; by her husband&#8217;s
commands she was magnificent, amazing, in one
of Tartare&#8217;s most startling gowns; a vivid sulphur,
shaded to orange, half veiled in silver gauze, and here
and there deepened with black. It had the effect that
Blagdon desired and made everyone in the room open
their eyes. There was no question of its expense and
execution&mdash;but it was theatrical. Yes, that was how
the guests spoke of it, &#8216;theatrical!&#8217;&mdash;a robe more
suitable to the emancipated wife in a big society play,
a <i>divorc&eacute;e&#8217;s</i> robe, in which to trail the stage, and storm
and scoff, and vow and weep, than to a young girl-bride
in her own drawing-room.</p>

<p>Letty wore, also, the splendid Blagdon diamonds,
and these, that would have been proper enough with
her wedding gown, added just the required touch of
lawless extravagance to her appearance.</p>

<p>Beside the house-party, and a smart young Guardsman,
there were three guests from the village: the
Reverend Adrian Lumley, Frances his daughter and
Lancelot his son. The Rector was a white-haired man
of sixty, handsome, erect, and dignified. For years he
had been an army chaplain in India, now he shepherded
a country flock. He and Lord Gaythorne were
old Harrovians, and had a good deal to say to one
another; the Bishop and the Dowager Mrs. Blagdon,
discussed a London Mission, and the M.F.H. a May fox.</p>

<p>The dinner was excellent, and went off with great<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_155"></a>[155]</span>
decorum, but it was prodigiously dull. There was a
little talk of golf, of a local engagement, the prospects of
grouse, a recent by-election, and a threatened bazaar.</p>

<p>Mrs. Fenchurch glanced up and down the table with
unconcealed pride. The guests were all the &#8216;best
people,&#8217; no small fry; the silver candelabra and cups
were superb, the flowers exquisite, the m&eacute;nu everything
a m&eacute;nu should be. Round about her, waited
many silent and efficient servants, and there at the
head of the table in gorgeous apparel, and blazing
jewels, sat little Letty, her niece by marriage.</p>

<p>This dazzling vision established the lady more firmly
than ever in the belief in her own infallibility; for
this position, and all her other mercies, Letty had to
thank <i>her</i>; and she drank off a glass of champagne to
her own good health.</p>

<p>It struck young Lumley that the bride, for all her
magnificence, did not appear to be in particularly
radiant spirits&mdash;that from time to time she cast
timid and deprecating glances towards the master
of the house; her smiles were rare, and her face
wore a curious blighted look, and had lost something
of the round, fresh touch of happy youth.</p>

<p>She talked, yet appeared afraid to utter a word;
once he had intercepted a scowl that Mr. Blagdon had
cast at the lower end of the table, and during a pause
he had called out in a harsh, dominating voice:</p>

<p>&#8220;I say, what a noise you are all making down there.
What a jovial, merry party! I&#8217;m glad my wife is so
amusin&#8217;.&#8221;</p>



<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_156"></a>[156]</span>His wife became pink, and then in halting sentences,
began to tell Lord Gaythorne and the Bishop, her
immediate neighbours, some little tales respecting
their recent excursions and experiences. Having
secured the attention of the company, and during a
dead silence, in her clear, girlish voice, she proceeded
to relate how they had made a delightful trip with Sir
Algy and Lady Vickery, and had all dined together
at an old inn in the mountains and driven back by
moonlight. This story was listened to in horrified
amazement, as it was a well-known fact that Sir Algy
Vickery was <i>not</i> a married man. Kind Lady Gaythorne
burst in upon the pause, with jerky recollections
of her own honeymoon,&mdash;now a matter of somewhat
ancient history,&mdash;but once again the little bride,
anxiously striving to entertain, brought forward in
all innocence, one of the stories which she had heard in
Paris. The unhappy girl had not the remotest idea
that she was retailing a hideously improper <i>double
entendre</i> (a recent <i>succ&egrave;s</i> of the Boulevards). She only
remembered that when told by Lady Slater it had been
received&mdash;why she could not say&mdash;with yells of laughter
and applause. When she concluded, there ensued a grim
and petrifying silence. To the ladies, the tale was
cryptic; to most of the men it was as if a bomb had
exploded on the mahogany! Lord Gaythorne gasped,
the Master of Hounds choked convulsively in his
serviette. As for the Bishop, he had been changed into
an image of stone. The guests stared blankly at their
girlish hostess, dressed in the most <i>outr&eacute;</i> French style,<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_157"></a>[157]</span>
and calmly relating the Frenchiest of stories! But she
turned on them a face of beautiful, child-like innocence,
and actually seemed to appeal for their approval,
and applause.</p>

<p>This pitiful incident had far-reaching results. By
gradual degrees, the intelligence filtered through the
County, that Blagdon&#8217;s pretty young wife was a simpleton&mdash;just
one degree removed from a mere imbecile.
What a pity! Unconscious of her enormity, the bride
made a timid sign to Lady Gaythorne, and rose from
her place. She was presently made aware that her
first dinner-party had been a failure, for as her husband
held the door open for the ladies to pass forth,
the glance he threw at her, was charged with fury.</p>

<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_158"></a>[158]</span>

<h2 class="nobreak">CHAPTER XV</h2>
</div>


<p class="drop-cap">ONCE in the vast drawing-room, most of the ladies
scattered about or assembled in congenial groups.
Mrs. Fenchurch wandered round, eyeglass in hand,
examining the miniatures and old china, with the
air of a connoisseur, and possible purchaser! Lady
Gaythorne and Lady Belford conferred together over
the character of a housekeeper, the Bishop&#8217;s helpmate
whispered of family troubles to her cousin, the wife
of the County Member, and Frances Lumley and the
girl hostess made advances to one another; they
were likely to be friends as well as neighbours, and
Letty felt drawn to this charming, light-hearted
girl, who, although unmarried at the great age of
twenty-six, had evidently far more experience and
decision than herself.</p>

<p>Meanwhile the rheumatic dowager, enthroned on a
sofa, presented a picture of frozen dignity; to her the
coffee had tasted as gall and wormwood, her mind
being embittered by the outrageous behaviour of Mrs.
Fenchurch, who was playing the part of hostess with
considerable effect. Positively her attitude was that
of triumphant hospitality!</p>

<p>Numerous good works, and far-reaching activities,
had brought Mrs. Fen into contact with many of the<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_159"></a>[159]</span>
&#8216;best people.&#8217; An alert woman of the world, she had
interests in common with most of the matrons present;
she exchanged a word or two with Mrs. Mostyn, the
Bishop&#8217;s wife, respecting a certain charity; then she
flitted over to the Master&#8217;s lady to enquire about the
new Kennels, told Lady Belford of a marvellous cure
for Flue, and assured Lady Gaythorne that she could
give her two tickets for the Idiots&#8217; Home.</p>

<p>&#8220;She had much better keep one for her niece!&#8221;
muttered Lady Belford, who had three unmarried
daughters, and a sharp tongue.</p>

<p>In short, Mrs. Fenchurch was, so to speak, the presiding
personality, the chairwoman of this drawing-room
meeting; whilst the mistress of the house sat
in a corner talking eagerly to the girl from the Rectory.</p>

<p>From the sofa, the Dowager&#8217;s soul went forth in arms.
How dared this pushing, notoriously managing
woman, ignore and eclipse two Mrs. Blagdons under
their own roof&mdash;the home of <i>her</i> ancestors? There she
was, actually exhibiting, and with pride, the Scrope
Nankin Vases, that had been in the family for centuries,
and drawing Lady Calthorpe&#8217;s special attention to a
Cosway miniature of Angelina Scrope, her <i>own</i> grandmother.
Oh, it was insufferable! Such manners should
be dealt with by the penal laws.</p>

<p>Presently Mrs. Fen, in blissful ignorance of these
smouldering fires, sailed across the room and sat down
on the sofa in order to pay a little attention to old Mrs.
Blagdon, &#8220;who seemed rather out of it&#8221;; but her
polite advances were not welcomed. The Dowager<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_160"></a>[160]</span>
declined to go into raptures over Jade, and pictures,
to enlarge on objects familiar to Caroline Scrope since
she could toddle; treasures which had been her own
exclusive possessions for many years.</p>

<p>&#8220;Oh yes,&#8221; she assented icily, &#8220;no doubt these
things in our collection impress an outsider. I was
amused in watching you, as you went round exhibiting
her relatives to Lady Calthorpe, who, however, has
been here hundreds of times&mdash;and I could not help
thinking what a capital person you would be as show-woman,
in some historical house, such as Knole or
Penshurst!&#8221;</p>

<p>This was a nasty speech, and entirely beneath the
dignity of a Scrope; but the old lady was on fire;
she was particularly sensitive with respect to Sharsley,&mdash;every
bush and tree, every old book, and chair of
which, were sacred to her; and to behold an absolute
stranger, vaunting its treasures and doing the honours,
was an exasperating and distracting experience.</p>

<p>Presently, she and her companion were engaged in a
lady-like sparring match; and (the shameful confession
must be made) occasionally dealt one another what is
known as &#8216;blows below the belt.&#8217; The Dowager, conveyed
by looks and implication, more than actual
speech, that her opponent had been undeservedly
fortunate in placing her penniless niece in what had
once been her own shoes! Mrs. Fenchurch, her blue
blood boiling in her veins, had no hesitation in conveying
to the Dowager, that she considered that her
son was exceptionally favoured in marrying a girl who<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_161"></a>[161]</span>
had well-born relations on <i>both</i> sides&mdash;and here she
distinctly scored.</p>

<p>The attitude of these two matrons did not tend to
promote conviviality; there was a vague impression
of outstretched claws and flying fur, and the long-looked-for
entrance of the men effected a happy diversion.
The grand piano stood open, and the word
&#8216;music&#8217; was breathed by someone&mdash;possibly Mrs.
Fenchurch.</p>

<p>&#8220;Come along, Letty, and let us have some of your
parlour tricks,&#8221; said her husband, to whom a generous
quantity of generous wine, had brought a certain
amount of suavity.</p>

<p>The bride, silent and pale, rose immediately and
went to the instrument, and although her voice and
fingers seemed a little tremulous, gained confidence
as soon as her uncle came and stood beside her. Her
singing was voted delightful, and made a remarkable
impression; the Rector&#8217;s thoughts flew to his choir;
Lady Calthorpe&#8217;s to a charity concert. The voice was
so fresh, so sweet, so flexible, and well trained; but to
Lumley, mechanically turning over the leaves of an
album, it was something more&mdash;to him it seemed to
carry a note of hopelessness and despair.</p>

<p>Meanwhile Blagdon lay back in an arm-chair with
one solid leg crossed over the other, and an expression
on his flushed face which seemed to say:</p>

<p>&#8220;That&#8217;s <i>my</i> property&mdash;my musical-box!&#8221;</p>

<p>Young Lumley could hardly restrain his fury; he
felt a savage inclination, to rise and kick the complacent<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_162"></a>[162]</span>
host, round his own drawing-room. Several
ladies succeeded one another at the piano, and Miss
Lumley gave a notable performance of Grieg and
Chopin, during which, general conversation waxed
both loud and animated.</p>

<p>By and by card-tables were produced, and people
sat down to the good old game of whist. Mrs. Fenchurch,
who was not a card-player, came over and
seated herself beside her niece, armed with many
sharp questions.</p>

<p>&#8220;Now tell me, dear,&#8221; she began, &#8220;how do you like
your housekeeper? I suppose she has been here for
years?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Yes, I believe so.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;And manages everything?&#8221; she demanded.</p>

<p>&#8220;Yes, Aunt Dorothy.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Well, mind you don&#8217;t let her manage <i>you</i>,&#8221; she
urged with dictatorial emphasis. &#8220;Take everything
into your own hands. Of course, you have gone
over the silver?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;No, not yet.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Oh, my dear! Nor the house-linen?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;No.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;But, dearest child, you mustn&#8217;t get into slack
ways, but begin as you intend to go on. Oh, by the
way, Tucker came to me <i>so</i> injured, and affronted.
Why did you dismiss her?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Because Hugo didn&#8217;t think she was a good
maid.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Good gracious&mdash;what can <i>he</i> know about it?&#8221;</p>



<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_163"></a>[163]</span>&#8220;He knows a good deal, and is very particular. He
can&#8217;t bear some of my trousseau dresses.&#8221;</p>

<p>(She might have added, that he had told her to burn
them!)</p>

<p>&#8220;Oh, my dear, what rubbish! You know, I got them
at Stile&#8217;s, where my mother bought mine&mdash;everything
<i>they</i> have is always of the very best. Look at this,&#8221;
indicating her own hideous garment. &#8220;If you begin by
allowing Hugo to dismiss your maid, and worry about
your dresses, I&#8217;m sure I don&#8217;t know where you will
end! You really <i>must</i> learn to assert yourself.&#8221; Then
she went on to enquire about the neighbours, and who
Letty had seen in London? and who had called? and
who hadn&#8217;t called? and many other tiresome questions.</p>

<p>Letty&#8217;s pleasantest moments were snatched with
her uncle. In his company, her depressed spirits
seemed to bubble up to the surface, and she actually
laughed. Her husband, who was playing whist, paused
to stare at her; it was such an unusual occurrence,
and her laugh sounded so merry and girlish. She never
laughed like that when she was with <i>him</i>!</p>

<p>Before Mrs. Fenchurch concluded her visit, she had
taken certain observations; perhaps, after all, like
the princess with a pea in the feather bed, little Letty
had some drawbacks in her fine home&mdash;an odious,
arrogant, formidable mother-in-law, cold as ice; and
a selfish, egotistical, self-indulgent husband, who
snubbed her already&mdash;yes, and openly!</p>

<p>&#8220;I must give you just one little word, dearest
Letty,&#8221; she whispered to her, before they separated.<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_164"></a>[164]</span>
&#8220;I want you to assert yourself, and talk, and offer
your opinion, and take your proper place as the mistress
of this splendid establishment. Why, my dear
child, you look every moment as if you were a naughty
little girl who expected to be put in the corner.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I have only been here two weeks,&#8221; stammered the
poor bride; &#8220;and of course I am not accustomed to
all this grandeur <i>yet</i>. I shall get on all right by
and by.&#8221;</p>

<p>But Mrs. Fenchurch had her doubts. How the
agreeable, genial Blagdon seemed to have altered!
He now treated her with marked coolness, rarely addressed
her, and when she praised Letty, received her
encomiums in gloomy silence. After all, he might
prove a most unsatisfactory husband&mdash;he looked ill-tempered.</p>

<p>Mrs. Blagdon, for her part, had a few words to say
to her son before she flitted south.</p>

<p>&#8220;Hugo, I hope you and Letty will pull well together,&#8221;
to which he merely grunted a reply. &#8220;You
must make allowances for her. I think she is trying
hard to please you. She is a simple little thing&mdash;and
so young&mdash;not yet full grown&mdash;and her mind only
half developed.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Half baked, you mean!&#8221; he corrected angrily.</p>

<p>&#8220;No, no; she has plenty of brains. What she wants,
is worldly wisdom; her French is perfect, and her
singing and playing astonishing for her age.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Just school accomplishments!&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;The others will come; but Letty really won&#8217;t be<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_165"></a>[165]</span>
fit to be mistress of this great place, to look the part,
and to hold her own, for a couple of years.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;If ever!&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Now, suppose you were to close Sharsley for a
little, and travel, and let her see the world, and mix
in society?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;No, thank you,&#8221; he rejoined with laboured emphasis.
&#8220;I&#8217;ve had enough of travel with <i>Letty</i>. She
is all for sights and sunsets, and hideous old pictures
and damp churches. She has no fun or go, no what
you call <i>joie de vivre</i>. As for mixing in society, she
is a fish out of water, and without tact or sense. Why
you yourself heard the story she related at dinner,&mdash;one
of Lady Slater&#8217;s <i>worst</i>&mdash;and that without turning
a hair!&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;It showed the poor child&#8217;s innocence,&#8221; rejoined
his mother, &#8220;and the sort of people with whom you
allowed her to associate.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Any way&mdash;it will be talked of for the next ten years!
and I&#8217;ll tell you what, mum,&#8221; he added, nodding his
head and looking down at her with his hard, sullen
eyes. &#8220;I find I&#8217;ve made a most infernal mistake!&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Well, Hugo, remember that I warned you; the
wife to have suited you, would have been a smart young
widow, who knew her way about, who was clever and
ambitious, and could hold her own. I must confess I
am sorry for Letty!&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Bah! she&#8217;s just a little shivering idiot.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I expect her aunt drove her into the marriage.
Oh, Hugo, what an awful woman; so thrusting, managing,<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_166"></a>[166]</span>
and overbearing. For all her good birth, and being
first cousin to the Marquis of Camberwell, she is not a
lady.&#8221; She had not forgotten their passage-at-arms,
and repeated with conviction, &#8220;No, she is <i>not</i>!&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;But a regular old campaigner! I believe poor
Fenchurch can&#8217;t call his soul his own. She&#8217;d sell the
hunters under him without winking, and allows him a
shilling a week for baccy. I won&#8217;t have her over here
prying and picking. I&#8217;m not a mean chap, nor stingy,
but when I put her in the brougham, I saw that she had
a hamper of plants from the hothouse, the best of the
spaniel pups, and a china jar. She told me, with a
grin, she begged it of dearest Letty, who had two.
She won&#8217;t come here again, I bet a thousand pounds!&#8221;</p>

<p>But an experienced acquaintance would have backed
Mrs. Fenchurch,&mdash;and won!</p>

<h2 class="nobreak">CHAPTER XVI</h2>
</div>


<p class="drop-cap">SHARSLEY, its spreading park, and somewhat
neglected gardens, had been partly closed for
years; the owner merely visiting it spasmodically,
with lively parties for shooting or hunting. The
situation was isolated with regard to other seats: it
being the one great house of a poor and insignificant
neighbourhood. When Blagdon married, people hoped
that a new era was about to dawn; a pretty girl of
good family would be warmly welcomed as the social
queen, and the immediate residents hastened to wait
upon the bride.</p>

<p>First, came those known as &#8216;the small fry&#8217; or the
village; these included the two Miss Jessops&mdash;maiden
ladies of gentle birth, churchy, poor, and kindly;
Captain and Mrs. Howard, retired Army people,
agreeable and middle-aged&mdash;who had seen the world;
Mr. Byng, an Indian Civilian and keen politician, with
two pretty daughters who bicycled after the hounds
and kept prize poultry, and others of the same standing.
But these were not the class of visitors that
Blagdon desired to entertain, and his rudeness was
insufferable and undisguised.</p>

<p>When the Jessops, in their best bonnets, arrived to
make a first and formal call, and were ceremoniously<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_168"></a>[168]</span>
conducted into the grounds, where tea was laid in
the shade, the instant Blagdon beheld these ladies
approaching, he sprang to his feet and hastily departed
in the opposite direction. Truly this was a bad
moment for the bride! However, with many blushes
and in halting sentences, she assured the Misses Jessop
that her husband had suddenly remembered an important
engagement; but Letty was a very poor liar,
and her embarrassment, and her explanations, merely
aggravated the situation.</p>

<p>With a lofty air the ladies declined tea. Blagdon&#8217;s
snub had been too gross, and what, after all, was <i>he</i>?
The grandson of a collier, and they the granddaughters
of an Archbishop! They were sorry for the poor
child, his wife, talked to her condescendingly of flowers
and the weather, and presently effected a stately
departure.</p>

<p>When Captain Howard drove up with his wife to
make their first call at Sharsley, the windows being open,
they heard a beautiful soprano singing &#8216;Love Not.&#8217;</p>

<p>&#8220;Ah, she&#8217;s in,&#8221; said Mrs. Howard. &#8220;I&#8217;m <i>so</i> glad!&#8221;</p>

<p>But an impassive footman who received their cards
uttered a sonorous and decisive &#8216;Not at home,&#8217; and
they drove away, deeply mortified&mdash;the fate of many.</p>

<p>Later, as Blagdon stood turning over the card-tray
one afternoon, Letty adventured a timid expostulation.</p>

<p>&#8220;Now look here,&#8221; he said impatiently, &#8220;I&#8217;m not
going to have gossiping women, and sponging old men,
running in and out of this house, sniffing about for
what they can get&mdash;amusement, shootin&#8217;, and good<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_169"></a>[169]</span>
dinners. I have my own friends, and I don&#8217;t want
their society. You can just send round your cards
by a footman,&mdash;and let that end it. Of course, the
County is another affair,&#8221; still examining the cards
as he spoke. &#8220;Viscount and Viscountess Lyndham,
Sir Cosmo and Lady Alice Danvers&mdash;yes, these sort of
people are all right. By the way, I see the Duchess
hasn&#8217;t honoured you yet&mdash;she&#8217;s taking her time.
The old girl wanted to saddle <i>me</i> with one of her ugly
daughters, so she won&#8217;t be very keen upon you, Mrs.
Blagdon!&#8221;</p>

<p>The expected &#8216;County&#8217; now came day after day
rolling up the Avenue to visit Sharsley; and the shy
bride, seated alone in a magnificent new landau, drove
about the country, returning calls, and inwardly praying
that her hostesses might be out! being secretly
afraid of the solid, important matrons, among whom
she now took rank&mdash;as Mrs. Blagdon of Sharsley.
She noted the merry bicyclists who sped by in couples,
the happy good-looking pair, evidently lately married,
driving in a high tax-cart, he with his arm round the
girl&#8217;s waist, their faces radiant with smiles,&mdash;a sheep
their fellow-passenger.</p>

<p>They stared with wide-eyed admiration at the
lovely young lady in a beautiful dress, sitting so erect
behind a pair of slashing steppers,&mdash;and little dreamt
how she envied them!</p>

<p>Her husband made no secret of his disgust, and
disillusion; scenes were frequent&mdash;when he scolded,
blustered, and stormed, she wept; when they were<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_170"></a>[170]</span>
alone, conversation was nil; to her timid questions,
the answers were generally a grunt; and the miserable
girl began to feel that her youth was paralysed and
petrified. Often and often, she wished herself back
once more in the little top-room at The Holt&mdash;could
more be said? There, she was partly free; here, she
was an abject slave; and at the beck and call of a
man whom she heartily feared.</p>

<p>The newly married couple, were invited to formal
dinners or to dine, and sleep, at various important
places, and the general verdict on the bride was, that
she was a pretty nonentity, dull as a kitchen-garden
on a winter&#8217;s day, who looked positively ashamed of
her French gowns and her superb diamonds; and it
was no love match.</p>

<p>Hugo contradicted his wife flatly; he had been
overheard to assure her that her hat was hideous, and
she&mdash;worse still&mdash;&#8220;was a wooden-headed little fool.&#8221;</p>

<p>Part of August and September found the Blagdons
in Scotland; by the time they had returned home,
they had drifted almost entirely apart.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>It was true, that Blagdon had his own friends and
was superbly independent of his neighbours; numerous
guests came from London for pheasant-shooting and
hunting, at Sharsley they were all thoroughly at
home&mdash;indeed, considerably more so than the hostess
herself! Lady Rashleigh, had her particular bedroom&mdash;this
was natural&mdash;but why Mrs. Corbett
should claim, and occupy, the best of all the state<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_171"></a>[171]</span>
apartments was another affair. Sir Tom and Lady
Slater, Lord Robbie and the Baron, and a Colonel
Shaddock, who knew everyone, went everywhere,
and was a notorious gossip and an irresistible horse-dealer,
and various others. There was no doubt, that
the party stirred up sleepy old Sharsley, and made it
lively, with early starts for cubbing, and late hours
for nap and poker; the guests were well acquainted
with the resources of the stable and the cellar, the
best stands in the woods and coverts, even wise and
self-seeking with respect to the most comfortable chairs,
and told the bride many things about her home that
she now learnt for the first time.</p>

<p>The new mistress made a rather scared and silent
hostess; indeed, she was a mere figure-head and
nonentity. Lady Rashleigh and Lola Corbett rode
Hugo&#8217;s best horses, smoked his best cigarettes, lounged
about on sofas, issued orders, and did what seemed
good in their own eyes.</p>

<p>The great rooms rang with loud voices, and boisterous
laughter, and the company talked incessantly of
horses, racing, and scandal. Several of the party had
brought their hunters; others were mounted by their
host. Mrs. Corbett, who for all her langourous grace,
rode admirably; she had nerves and muscles of iron&mdash;no
day too long for her, provided she had a second horse.
Lady Rashleigh rode a solid fourteen stone, and gave
sore backs to some of her brother&#8217;s weight-carriers;
whilst Lady Slater came out on wheels, and made no
secret of the fact that she funked riding.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_172"></a>[172]</span>Letty, in a smart habit and mounted on a quiet cob,
looked well in the saddle; nevertheless at the meets
she was left a good deal to herself; as she was not
acquainted with the hard-riding set, the intimates
of her husband, and his friends, and the neighbours
on horseback, or in governess cars, stared over her
head with glassy eyes. Her husband&#8217;s &#8216;ukase&#8217; had
placed her in the middle of a social desert,&mdash;where her
only associates were the Lumley family. Lancelot
Lumley was home on leave, and when he was out&mdash;about
once a week&mdash;Mrs. Blagdon had someone to
ride with and talk to. Her husband&#8217;s sporting friends,
granted her pretty face and frightened-looking blue
eyes; but, as one of them declared, &#8220;She could not
say boo to a gosling!&#8221;</p>

<p>In some ways, Letty enjoyed the hunting: the
eager crowd of yokels at the meets, the splendid
horses, the odd turns-out, and the general spirit of
<i>camaraderie</i> and enjoyment. It was not bad fun
galloping along grassy lanes, darting through convenient
open gates, now and then getting over a small
fence, and feeling absurdly proud and brave! Her
prowess and improvement were remarked, and Lady
Rashleigh said one day at dinner:</p>

<p>&#8220;Look here, Letty, we must promote you, especially
as the cob is lame&mdash;he has a seedy toe. We cannot
any longer allow you to go skirmishing about the
roads, trying to see all you can,&mdash;and save your neck!
You are to ride The Goat; he will carry you splendidly.
I rode him last season.&#8221;</p>



<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_173"></a>[173]</span>&#8220;The Goat, would be too much for you, Mrs. Blag,&#8221;
volunteered Lord Robbie. &#8220;Take my tip, and don&#8217;t
you ride him; he has only one side to his mouth.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Shut up, Robbie!&#8221; said Lady Rashleigh. &#8220;Letty
can stick on all right, she&#8217;s got to learn. We shall see
her in the first flight yet. By the way, what happened
to <i>you</i> in the second run? I saw old Sarsfield pirouetting
on his head!&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Only a rabbit hole; we both bit the earth&mdash;no
harm done. If the cob is lame, Sarsfield would be
a safe conveyance for Mrs. Blag much steadier than
The Goat.&#8221;</p>

<p>Nevertheless it was The Goat, a raking chestnut 16&middot;2
in hard condition, who proved to be Letty&#8217;s fate; in
spite of her piteous, even agonised, protestations. Her
husband, accustomed to such hard-riding women as his
sister and friends, could not understand her nervousness;
he set it down to affectation, assured her that
&#8220;The Goat was as quiet as a lamb. All he wanted
was to go; all she had to do, was to sit tight.&#8221;</p>

<p>Mounted on this tall, headstrong animal, a first-class
hunter and mount for a muscular and resolute man,
Letty looked as she felt, abjectly miserable,&mdash;whilst
her sister-in-law and Lola, unkindly derided her fears.
The Goat was so different to the nice, sedate, well-mannered
cob; he fretted and shied, threw his head about,
dragging the reins through her cold, stiff fingers; and
became frightfully excited when the hounds, and the
whips, streamed pleasantly through the village street;
her futile efforts to quiet him were ridiculed by<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_174"></a>[174]</span>
Blagdon, who audibly called her &#8220;a chicken-hearted
little fool.&#8221; All she had to do was to let the brute
alone; he couldn&#8217;t give her a fall if he tried!</p>

<p>As the mass of riders and drivers jogged off in the
wake of the hounds, Lumley, filled with burning indignation
and compassion, joined the white-faced
victim. To mount a nervous, inexperienced girl on
this hard-mouthed, powerful brute, was, in his opinion,
not far from a bold attempt at murder.</p>

<p>He, however, gave her confidence, and encouragement,
and when the hounds were put into cover, piloted
her away down a by-road, where he dismounted, and
altered The Goat&#8217;s bit. Lumley was at home in this
part of the world, he knew every fence and field like
his A B C, and by merely sticking to roads and gates
Letty and her escort, got over a respectable amount
of the country, and actually made their appearance
soon after the fox (a well-known veteran) was run to
ground in a quarry pit.</p>

<p>Blagdon and his friends hailed the lady&#8217;s arrival,
with boisterous shouts, and, after some hesitation
and an anxious five minutes, her husband assented to
her timid suggestion, &#8216;that <i>now</i> she might go home.&#8217;</p>

<p>Unfortunately Lumley did not happen to be out on
the memorable day when Mrs. Blagdon was overpowered
by her mount, and The Goat, after plunging
and rearing,&mdash;frantic at being held in, and stimulated
by galloping horses, let himself go,&mdash;and, with a light
weight on his back, carried his reluctant rider in the very
first flight, for two triumphant miles. It was true she<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_175"></a>[175]</span>
was frozen with fear, her heart thumped like a turbine
engine; but she passed Connie Rashleigh as an arrow
from a bow, and cut down the Baron and the redoubtable
Lola. Such was The Goat&#8217;s enthusiasm, such his
passion for the chase, that he followed hard upon the
hounds; vainly did the huntsman yell and swear, the
lady was helpless&mdash;this was The Goat&#8217;s day out! It
was also his last day. In negotiating a yawning fence
(wired) he came down badly, and a thrill went through
the spectators&mdash;Mrs. Blagdon was done for&mdash;she was
killed! No, The Goat had broken his back, but the
lady escaped with a fractured arm, and some bad
bruises. Presently a carriage and a gun were borrowed,
the former for the lady; and she was taken home by
her husband, who, far from being concerned and
sympathetic, was furious at the loss of a valuable
hunter, and angrily assured her that &#8220;she was a little
idiot to let the brute get away with her. Why, Connie
could ride him on a thread!&#8221;</p>

<p>Letty was a good deal shaken, her fracture was excessively
painful, and the doctor ordered her to keep her
room for at least a fortnight, which command she was
only too thankful to obey. Her nerves were completely
shattered; she was visited by horrid dreams; dreams
of flying over great ragged brown hedges, with the
wind whistling past her ears, a fierce, implacable
demon pulling her arms out of their sockets, whilst
she and the runaway were pursued by frenzied shouts.</p>

<p>During these days of seclusion, the invalid saw but
little of her guests&mdash;by whom the absence of the hostess<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_176"></a>[176]</span>
was not deplored. Now and then, Connie Rashleigh
and Lola came to see her, and Hugo paid her a daily
visit of a few minutes. One evening he stayed longer
than usual, and strode up and down the room&mdash;a sure
sign that he had something on his mind. His restlessness
was accounted for by his suddenly asking her to
&#8220;let him have a look at the necklace with the emeralds.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Tell your maid to get it,&#8221; he said. &#8220;The fact is,
I bought that necklace for Lola Corbett, but we had a
row, or rather she annoyed me, and so I gave it to
you. All the same, she&#8217;s always looked upon the article
as hers, and it has rankled in her mind, and she is so
cracked about jewellery, and has ragged and nagged
so much about this damned necklace, that I feel bound
to give it to her. You&#8217;ll let me have it, won&#8217;t you,
Letty?&#8221;</p>

<p>His manner was almost persuasive. He was saying
to himself that if he had made a similar proposition
to Lola she would have flown into a rage, that would
have scared even him; but all his wife said was:</p>

<p>&#8220;Oh, of course! Desir&eacute;e shall get it out at once,
and I will send it to your room.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;That&#8217;s a good little girl,&#8221; he remarked approvingly.
(To himself, &#8216;She hadn&#8217;t the spirit of a mouse! He
would really have enjoyed a little bit of a scrap!&#8217;)
&#8220;All right,&#8221; he continued, &#8220;I will get you another,
and just as good, the very next time I am in Paris.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;No, no, Hugo,&#8221; she protested. &#8220;I really have more
diamonds and things than I can wear. But there
is something else&mdash;I&mdash;I&mdash;I wish you would give me.&#8221;</p>



<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_177"></a>[177]</span>Blagdon, who was half-way to the door, halted.</p>

<p>&#8220;What&#8217;s that?&#8221; he demanded, turning sharply
round.</p>

<p>&#8220;A little&mdash;a little&mdash;&mdash;&#8221; She was about to say &#8216;love,&#8217;
but, with an effort, faltered the word &#8220;affection.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;What <i>rot</i>!&#8221; he exclaimed, and looking her over
from head to foot, with a derisive laugh, he went out
of the room.</p>

<h2 class="nobreak">CHAPTER XVII</h2>
</div>


<p class="drop-cap">THE expected heir, for whom conspicuous preparations
had been made&mdash;bonfires laid ready
for the torch, name and sponsors solemnly selected&mdash;turned
out to be a girl. This was a severe and unconcealed
disappointment to Blagdon, and he allowed his
wife to feel the full brunt of his indignation, and displeasure.
The estate and all the property was strictly
entailed, and, after Hugo, it passed to a distant cousin
(naturally detested), a man who farmed a small sheep
ranch in New Zealand, and was reported to be barely
able to write his name.</p>

<p>Old Mrs. Blagdon who had come to Sharsley for the
auspicious event, dissembled her dissatisfaction with
well-bred dignity, and took a certain amount of notice
of the unwelcome infant (her namesake), a fair little
waxen creature, adored by her mother from the moment
she was laid in her arms.</p>

<p>The great bonfires remained unlit, the charitable
doles were withheld, the grand dinner to the tenantry
was cancelled; and Blagdon, like a sulky schoolboy,
left home to be consoled by his usual associates.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>Three years had slipped by since the sensational and<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_179"></a>[179]</span>
still-talked-of wedding at Thornby, and although a
good deal of water had flowed under the bridge, it had
brought no pleasant flotsam to the feet of Letty Blagdon.
Her husband deserted her for months at a time;
he had taken to racing, owned a stable and rented
rooms at Newmarket, as well as a hunting-box in the
shires, declaring that Sharsley, as a hunting centre,
was obsolete. He frequently went abroad <i>en gar&ccedil;on</i>,
assuring inquisitive friends, that &#8220;his wife loathed the
Continent, and that nothing would induce her to leave
the child.&#8221;</p>

<p>During the first months of Letty&#8217;s married life the
Court had opened its long-closed doors, and maintained
something of its ancient state; there had been dinners,
shoots, and visitors; more than once Aunt Dorothy
had adventured over from Thornby, put up her horses,
and accorded to her miserable niece, a critical and
inquisitive &#8216;day&#8217;; but a twenty-mile drive is a
serious undertaking, and Mrs. Fenchurch contented
herself with boasting to her friends of Mrs. Blagdon&#8217;s
enviable happiness, and the beauties, and luxuries, of
her home.</p>

<p>Not so Uncle Tom! He missed&mdash;sorely missed&mdash;the
light of his eyes, the joy of his heart, and felt guiltily
anxious with regard to her future. Mounted on Kitty,
a notable Irish mare, he rode over to Sharsley every
few weeks; when the master of the house happened
to be at home these excursions had the effect of
emphasising his apprehensions. The tone in which
Blagdon addressed his wife, his rudeness, and the<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_180"></a>[180]</span>
ferocity of his sarcasms made the thin blood of the old
soldier mount to his face; and yet the host mended his
manners when Letty&#8217;s uncle was present. Fenchurch
was such a starched-up old cock;&mdash;and that a man of
his age would ride forty miles just to see a relative,
awakened Blagdon&#8217;s amusement and surprise.</p>

<p>&#8220;The old boy looks bad&mdash;he&#8217;s breaking!&#8221; he
abruptly remarked to his wife one afternoon after her
uncle had ridden away.</p>

<p>Letty had observed a change; the hale little officer
now looked worn and grey; he had grown thin, and
lost his cheery manner; when Hugo noticed anything
of that sort, it must be woefully apparent! However,
she made no answer, and winked back her tears, and
her husband resumed:</p>

<p>&#8220;I&#8217;m surprised Mrs. Fen has not done for him long
ago, with her jaw and her managing, and her damned
hatchet face. Thank God she doesn&#8217;t show it here!&#8221;
and with this congratulation on his lips, Blagdon departed.</p>

<p>By and by the forty-mile ride proved too much for
Kitty; so said her master; he sent her a night before
to a half-way village inn (where, according to the
landlady, Queen Elizabeth had slept the night before
her head was cut off!), drove there himself next day,
and rode her on to Sharsley.</p>

<p>These visits seemed to afford him the greatest pleasure,
though it was evident to Letty that they entailed
an extraordinary effort. Each time she saw her uncle,
she noted, with a sinking heart, a waning of his spirits<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_181"></a>[181]</span>
and a wasting of his frame. He would never admit
that he was ailing&mdash;and in this make-believe he was
nobly supported by his wife. He had a horror of not
being able to do what he had always done, and the
iron will of his Dorothy, and his own frantic clinging
to activity, compelled the poor, frail body to shoot and
hunt as usual. The few hours he spent with Letty
when he found her alone, were truly a joy and comfort
to both. On these occasions, they never spoke of Hugo;
but Cara the baby was exhibited, praised, and played
with, and her mother made amazing efforts to seem
gay. She realised, that Uncle Tom believed her to be
unhappily married, and that this conviction was breaking
his heart; and she strove very anxiously to play
the part of a gay and contented young woman, who does
not object to being a grass widow, or to be left by herself
for months (to him she spoke of weeks), but the farce
was a failure; the unsuccessful actress read this in her
uncle&#8217;s haggard eyes, and in the long, significant pressure
of his hand, ere he wished her good-bye, and sadly
rode away.</p>

<p>And one June afternoon Kitty and the Colonel rode
away, never to return, for a week later Colonel Fenchurch
was found sitting in his chair in the smoking-room,
with Letty&#8217;s last letter in his stiffening hand,
quite dead. The poor little Colonel had not much to
bequeath, but by a recent will he left forty pounds a year
to his beloved niece Lettice Blagdon&mdash;and not all the
Fenchurch pictures, diamonds, and heirlooms, could
console his bereaved widow for this unnecessary legacy.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_182"></a>[182]</span>&#8220;So cruel to <i>me</i>!&#8221; she imparted in confidence to
her intimates; &#8220;and so preposterous&mdash;as if Letty had
not more money than she can spend!&#8221;</p>

<p>But possibly the dead man had his reasons; perhaps
he had been granted the far-sighted vision which is
given to those who are nearing the border-land.</p>

<p>His relict affected not only overwhelming grief, but
the direst poverty. After the funeral, and when matters
were being wound up, she endeavoured to sell a
couple of hunters to Hugo.</p>

<p>&#8220;No, by Jove!&#8221; he exclaimed, as he tossed down
the letter; &#8220;I think I see myself&mdash;the bay has a
spavin, the black is touched in the wind. Your aunt
did me <i>once</i>,&#8221; glaring over at Letty with unpleasant
significance; &#8220;but never again&mdash;once bitten, twice
shy!&#8221;</p>

<p>The thrifty lady was more successful in her transactions
with her niece; to whom she submitted two
tea-gowns, a driving-coat, and an opera mantle; the
lot one hundred pounds.</p>

<p>&#8220;You see,&#8221; she wrote, &#8220;I shall be in black for such
an age, and I&#8217;m frightfully hard up&#8221; (she had eighteen
hundred a year and expectations) &#8220;so, Letty, you really
must take them off my hands. Think of all I&#8217;ve done
for <i>you</i>!&#8221; and Letty was, as usual, obedient.</p>

<p>She felt her uncle&#8217;s death acutely; he and the baby
were all she had to love and to love her&mdash;for Hugo had
told her a thousand times that he hated the sight of
her&mdash;and except Maude Hesketh and Frances Lumley,
she had no friends.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_183"></a>[183]</span>Frances Lumley was a clever, bright, energetic
young woman, whose brother, she declared, had stolen
her good looks. &#8220;By rights the boy should be the
plain one of the family&mdash;and it is <i>I</i> who am ugly.&#8221;</p>

<p>But this was an extreme statement; Miss Lumley&#8217;s
figure was the embodiment of slim grace, her hair soft
and beautiful; her eyes, though sparkling and intelligent,
were too small; her mouth, on the other hand,
was too large; perhaps had their dimensions been
reversed, Blagdon, who found her amusing and outspoken,
might have asked her to marry him! The
Rector&#8217;s daughter was popular with all degrees of
society; a first-rate musician, an entertaining companion,
and a capable nurse. The cottagers adored
her, &#8220;Miss Frances was so funny, and told them such
queer tales, all the while she was working over a case,
you scarcely could tell you had a sore leg or a boil, or
a burn, she was that clever with her fingers, and her
tongue.&#8221; She was also her father&#8217;s right hand, copied
out his sermons, wrote his letters, read to him, and
cared for him like a guardian angel.</p>

<p>Miss Lumley was pathetically anxious to extend her
sheltering wing over the poor lonely girl at the big
house, and did her utmost to entice her to the Rectory,
to tea, to tennis, to visit among the cottagers&mdash;in short,
to make some break in that solitary monotonous
existence.</p>

<p>&#8220;When Aunt Denton used to fill her letters with
<i>you</i>,&#8221; she said, &#8220;I little expected that her Letty would
be the great lady here, that she would go on my errands,<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_184"></a>[184]</span>
and mend my gloves, and that I should see so much of
her.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Too much, I&#8217;m afraid&mdash;this is the third time I am
here in a week!&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Can&#8217;t have too much of a good thing! and you
come to be useful&mdash;you are always ornamental&mdash;and
help me with the Sewing Club, you know you have
nothing to do in that big rambling place. Fraser
won&#8217;t let you touch the garden, the rouged and rustling
Bates runs the house&mdash;all you may do is to practise
your singing and play patience.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;But I never play cards,&#8221; protested Letty.</p>

<p>&#8220;There are other games of patience, my dear&mdash;<i>pied
de la lettre</i>! Your husband has old-fashioned
ideas about his partner&#8217;s duties, but is up to date about
his own.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I don&#8217;t understand you, Francie.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;No? well then I&#8217;ll explain. The wife creed is in
his blood, and belongs to the prehistoric race that
treated women as beasts of burden, and beat them with
clubs; later on, women were domestic slaves, and
more recently&mdash;say a hundred years ago&mdash;mere nurses
and upper servants, kept at home all the year round
making samplers and pickles, and shirts, and jam&mdash;and
having babies!&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Frances!&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Am I raising the standard of revolt? I declare
you are looking quite scared. Lady Rashleigh holds
<i>my</i> views&mdash;modern and emancipated&mdash;no shirts or
pickles for <i>her</i>&mdash;only jam, and lots of the best! When<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_185"></a>[185]</span>
I was in Town the other day I saw her at the theatre;
she has grown enormous, and was simply bulging out
of her box. Lord Robbie was with her&mdash;displaying a
wonderful expanse of shirt front, and a dazzling diamond
stud that hit you in the eye&mdash;he looked <i>such</i> a dog! He
is rather fond of me, and runs down here after tea;
when you think he is snug in the smoking-room, he is
sitting, figuratively, at my feet. I wouldn&#8217;t marry
him for&mdash;let me see&mdash;three millions! There, I&#8217;ve
finished the last, and <i>my</i> herring-boning, is a work
of art.&#8221;</p>

<p>During her frequent visits to the Rectory, Mrs.
Blagdon was liable to encounter the &#8216;small fry&#8217;; at
first they stiffened, and looked at the lady with cold,
unrecognising eyes; but when they discovered that
this pretty, shy girl was guiltless of airs, and rather
afraid of <i>them</i>, they suffered her acquaintance, and
although they never entered one another&#8217;s houses,
spoke to her when they met, offered the names of new
books and new roses, and gave her, in the immediate
neighbourhood, an excellent character, as an inoffensive
nonentity.</p>

<p>By this time the County had almost forgotten the
existence of Mrs. Blagdon. She did not hunt or go to
balls, seemed to be perpetually in mourning, and was
said to suffer from &#8216;nerves,&#8217;&mdash;and nerves in this century
stand for so <i>much</i>! Occasionally she was to be met
on the roads, driving her baby in a little governess-car,
and looking ridiculously like some shy animal, that
hoped to escape the notice of mankind!</p>



<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_186"></a>[186]</span>Letty was lonely. She had never felt at home at
Sharsley, but as if she were on a visit to some stiff,
country house; it still seemed to hold the spirits of
the dead and gone Scropes, and the great drawing-room,
with its portraits of staring ancestors (long-waisted,
long-faced, and long-fingered), black Indian
cabinets, and book-cases of neglected books, gave her
a chill.</p>

<p>At distant intervals Mrs. Hesketh came over to
Sharsley (craftily and stealthily in the master&#8217;s absence),
to dine and sleep, and her brief visits were Letty&#8217;s
greatest pleasure. On the last of these occasions,
Blagdon returned unexpectedly, and in a black humour&mdash;one
of his most promising two-year-olds, had gone
wrong.</p>

<p>The afternoon before his arrival, Letty and her
friend had wandered about the grounds, talking of
everything but what was uppermost in their hearts&mdash;the
misery of one, the sympathy of the other. As they
paced along the elder understood how empty the life of
her companion was; she might not garden&mdash;the gardens
were let; she had not even a dog&mdash;the nursery
and the piano were her sole resources.</p>

<p>At tea Mrs. Hesketh realised that she was not a
welcome guest. Her host did not find it necessary to
conceal his sentiments; nor did she fail to remark,
the abominable way in which he addressed his wife,
and how he ordered her about, and pushed out of the
room before her.</p>

<p>Dinner was a truly sombre meal: the fish was cold,<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_187"></a>[187]</span>
and Mr. Blagdon had one of his worst attacks of
temper. Vainly did the visitor endeavour to make
light and airy conversation; he was so violent and
abusive after the servants had withdrawn, that Letty,
unable to restrain her tears, fled out of the room; but
brave Mrs. Hesketh remained to remonstrate and do
battle with the tyrant.</p>

<p>&#8220;If no one else is going to speak to you, Mr. Blagdon,
I will,&#8221; she began intrepidly. &#8220;Everyone is crying
shame on you for the way you neglect your young
wife.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I don&#8217;t care a damn what they say!&#8221; he roared.
&#8220;Let everyone mind their own business. She is jolly
well treated&mdash;too well.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Is it too well, that she should be shut up here alone
for months at a time? That she is cut off from all
associates of her own class&mdash;that she is never taken
into society?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;She has everything she wants,&#8221; he blustered; &#8220;a
fine house, and servants&mdash;and a baby. Why, my
mother&#8217;s mother who lived here, and never stirred
beyond the village, and was a woman of family&mdash;hadn&#8217;t
half such a good time!&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;That must have been more than a hundred years
ago, and the world has improved, and become enlightened
since then. Letty is a girl who has been
educated.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;And you mean to say my mother&#8217;s mother wasn&#8217;t?
Thank you!&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;You know very well what I mean.&#8221;</p>



<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_188"></a>[188]</span>&#8220;I&#8217;m damned if I know what you mean, by taking
me to task in this way, and calling me over the coals
in my own house,&#8221; and his expression was murderous.</p>

<p>&#8220;I am Letty&#8217;s friend.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Yes, and no doubt she has been whining to you,
and telling you fine tales?&#8221; he demanded with blazing
eyes, &#8220;and posing as a martyr.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;She has never breathed a word of her troubles to
me; but anyone can see that she is unhappy. I can&#8217;t
think why in the world you married her?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I can&#8217;t think why I did, either! I was deadly
sick of her at the end of a week. Upon my soul, I was!
Marriage is like a trap&mdash;you can&#8217;t have a wife on approval&mdash;when
you are in, there&#8217;s no way of getting
out! By Jove, I envy the Americans their divorce
laws&mdash;then she could go her way&mdash;and I mine. If
some smart young fellow would take a fancy to Letty,
and run off with her I should say &#8216;Wah-wah!&#8217;&#8221;</p>

<p>Mrs. Hesketh looked as she was&mdash;horrified.</p>

<p>&#8220;There are no smart young men about here,&#8221; he
added; &#8220;so Letty is all right&mdash;virtue is the absence
of temptation.&#8221;</p>

<p>Mrs. Hesketh rose slowly, turned her back upon her
host, walked to the door very quietly, opened it and
went out, leaving it wide. She found Letty in her own
room, sitting with her face in her hands,&mdash;a frequent
attitude.</p>

<p>&#8220;My child,&#8221; she began, &#8220;I have been talking to the
dreadful man downstairs that ill-fortune has given
you for a husband. He is&mdash;well, I won&#8217;t say any<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_189"></a>[189]</span>
more, but this&mdash;that I wish I could take you away
with me, and let you make a home with me&mdash;you
and the baby!&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;How I wish you could!&#8221; said Letty, pushing back
her hair as she spoke. &#8220;But there is no use in wishing.
I often wish I was dead&mdash;and it&#8217;s no good.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Well, remember, my dear, if ever you are at the
end of your tether, you must come to me.&#8221;</p>

<p>Letty gave her a glance of despair, then she rose
and said:</p>

<p>&#8220;I shall have to go down at once, for Hugo always
expects me to be in the drawing-room when he is there&mdash;he
likes me to sing the new musical comedies. He
says my voice sends him to sleep.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;My dear, if I were you, for once I would disappoint
your Saul! <i>I</i> do not intend to go downstairs again
to-night, and I shall leave you immediately after
breakfast to-morrow. Mr. Blagdon was outrageously
rude to you at dinner&mdash;apparently he imagined that
he can make you miserable with impunity, that you
will ignore his insults, and entertain him in the drawing-room
all smiles and songs. Believe me, you are making
a fatal mistake; possibly if you had resisted in the
first instance, things would never have come to such a
pass. You are not his wife, but his doormat!&#8221;</p>

<p>Again Mrs. Hesketh had sown a little seed. Letty
for once did resist, and the two friends remained together
talking until bed-time. Blagdon, finding the
drawing-room empty, glared round it, then stalked
into the smoking-room, where he smoked cigars and<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_190"></a>[190]</span>
drank whiskies and sodas in solitary state, and a condition
of volcanic indignation.</p>

<p>&#8220;Of course, the old woman was at the bottom of
Letty&#8217;s sulks&mdash;a damned meddlesome hag!&#8221; He
rang the bell and said to the footman:</p>

<p>&#8220;Tell Mrs. Hesketh&#8217;s maid to let her mistress know,
that her carriage is ordered to take her home at nine
o&#8217;clock to-morrow morning.&#8221;</p>

<h2 class="nobreak">CHAPTER XVIII</h2>
</div>


<p class="drop-cap">THE Rev. Adrian Lumley had been ailing for a considerable
time; he was no longer able to undertake
his parish duties, and compelled to employ a curate.
Lately his health had suddenly become so uncertain
that his son took three months&#8217; leave, and returned
from Egypt. Captain Lumley arrived looking handsome,
sunburnt, and cheery, and his sister Frances
realised that he was no longer the boy that, as her
younger brother, she had always managed, patronised,
and coerced. Lancelot had been adjutant of his
regiment, and acquired a manner of decision and
brevity that was new. He found his father frail,
broken-down, and evidently failing fast. For months,
the Rector had confined himself to his books and his
garden, and now he was a prisoner in his room. Perhaps
if the reverend gentleman had not been so completely
laid upon the shelf, matters at Sharsley might have
been smoothed over, and improved; but, as it was,
Blagdon had no one to withstand him; he had parted
with any scruples he might possess, and affairs had
gone from bad to worse. Except for a few days in
the shooting season, he had ceased to live at home.
Most of the rooms were closed, servants dismissed,
the gardens let, the horses sold. He had heavy<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_192"></a>[192]</span>
expenses elsewhere, and was not disposed to burn
the candle at both ends. He had allowed it to be
whispered into the ear of society, that his wife was
&#8216;not quite all there.&#8217; Magnified descriptions of her first
disastrous dinner-party, her bizarre gowns, her silence
and shyness, gave colour to this suggestion,&mdash;so said
his interested friends; and other people declared that
Blagdon was bad,&mdash;some even added, mad! Altogether
Sharsley was given a wide berth; it was out of the
way, more recent topics, quarrels, and scandals arose,
and poor young Mrs. Blagdon was comparatively
forgotten.</p>

<p>Frances had always divined that her brother had
cared for Letty Glyn. Of course, now that she was
married, she was out of his reach; still, in talking
over the country-side news, she studiously omitted any
particular reference to the Blagdons.</p>

<p>&#8220;What about the Court? How did they get on?&#8221;
her brother asked at last.</p>

<p>&#8220;Not very well,&#8221; she was obliged to confess; &#8220;he
is a strange sort of a man, and is but little at home.
He has a shocking temper.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;A nice sort of husband for her! Mrs. Fenchurch
should be proud of herself! Look here, Francis, you
must take me to call to-morrow.&#8221;</p>

<p>Lumley carried out his suggestion, but, as it happened,
unaccompanied by his sister, for at the last
moment, a dying parishioner had summoned her,
and he walked up to Sharsley alone.</p>

<p>It was summer, and in one respect Sharsley was<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_193"></a>[193]</span>
at its best; but, on the other hand, the neat trimness,
and the closely mown lawns appeared to be things of
the past. The place now wore a desolate, neglected
appearance, and as he approached, the visitor noticed
that the shutters of most of the rooms were closed, and
the avenue and gravel paths were full of weeds. On
enquiry at the door, he was informed that Mrs. Blagdon
was somewhere in the grounds, and after a search he
found her playing with her child&mdash;a beautiful little
golden-haired creature, now able to walk, attended
by a somewhat grim-looking nurse. Her mother,
sitting upon the grass making daisy-chains for her,
sprang up when she saw Lumley approaching, and
greeted him with smiles. But how she was changed!
He felt shocked. The roundness of Letty&#8217;s face was
gone; her beautiful blue eyes looked sunken, their
expression was strained and anxious; she might be
seven or eight years older than her real age&mdash;which
was little more than twenty. Evidently she had
passed through a devastating storm which had ravaged
her looks and broken her heart. It was as if he and
her husband had both coveted the same beautiful
flower, and Blagdon had plucked it, and thrown it
away to wither and die.</p>

<p>But there was no sign of depression in Mrs. Blagdon&#8217;s
manner or conversation; she asked many questions
about his regiment and Egypt; she talked of his father
and sister and Mrs. Hesketh. No, she had not been
over to Thornby for nearly a year. In answer to his
exclamation of astonishment, she coloured and said:</p>



<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_194"></a>[194]</span>&#8220;You see, I can&#8217;t very well leave baby.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Then I suppose they come over and see you fairly
often?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Not very often,&#8221; she answered, with a trembling
lip. She was not disposed to inform him, that her
husband had quarrelled with Mrs. Fenchurch, and
practically turned Mrs. Hesketh out of the house, and
hastily changed the subject.</p>

<p>Presently the grim-looking nurse picked up the
child, and said:</p>

<p>&#8220;It&#8217;s time for Miss Cara&#8217;s tea,&#8221; and was about to
carry her off when Lumley interposed.</p>

<p>&#8220;She is a darling!&#8221; he said, taking her little hand
in his as it hung over the nurse&#8217;s shoulder. &#8220;I don&#8217;t
know much about children, but she seems to be
perfect&mdash;and very like you,&#8221; and he raised the little
chubby fingers to his lips. Subsequently it was mooted
in the servants&#8217; hall, that that &#8220;&#8217;ere young Lumley the
officer, who had been strolling about the grounds with
the missus for the best part of an hour, had told her to
her face that she was perfect and a darling, and that
nurse had heard him say so, with her own two ears!&#8221;</p>

<p>No doubt it was from this source that the first faint
whisper of gossip rose, and was wafted into the village;
and possibly it was not very discreet of young Lumley
to come up to Sharsley alone,&mdash;or even with his sister,
two or three times a week. Passers-by peering through
the railings in the park walls, had paused and stared;
sometimes they could see <i>two</i> figures, pacing up and
down the long terrace!</p>



<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_195"></a>[195]</span>There was not the smallest harm in these walks
and visits. Lumley brought errands and notes from
Frances, and carried to her messages and books,
for just at this time their father was very ill, and
Frances was in close attendance, and never left the
Rectory.</p>

<p>Letty enjoyed one luxury, and that was a liberal
supply of books; no need for <i>her</i> to spend her allowance
on frocks, and the quarterly payments went in
relieving charities, subscribing to periodicals, and
buying literature. Sometimes, she told herself that
without these friends, that carried her out of her
gloomy, isolated life, she would have gone melancholy
mad. True, there was the child; but a baby aged
two and a half, cannot altogether fill the life of an
educated girl of twenty, and, besides this, the baby
had a nurse who stood on her dignity, and required
her nursery to herself.</p>

<p>Oh, the long, long hours that Letty spent alone, the
only breaks being a hurried visit to the Rectory. How
the pensive melancholy of the autumn woods oppressed
her! the low, grey fog, lying in the hollows of the
park, took the shape of shadowy spectres rising from
their graves; bare brown trees, rooted in carpets of
ruddy leaves, seemed to mock her with their crooked
branches, and the staring sun, sinking into the west,
to cast on her rays of pity and derision.</p>

<p>Yes, she had sold herself to escape immediate discomfort,
and this was her punishment: an existence
of loveless degradation. In winter, her solitude and<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_196"></a>[196]</span>
misery pressed on her still more cruelly; she could
relieve the villagers with blankets and coal, but what
could she do for the thousands of perishing birds, the
starving hares, the shivering cattle? The nights were
the worst, when the wind came sobbing to the
windows, shook the doors of the empty rooms, and
moaned among the trees, with the despairing cries of
a lost soul; rats in the old walls&mdash;and strange unaccountable
noises&mdash;made sleep&mdash;broken&mdash;and waking
a terror.</p>

<p>But here at last was summer! and she could spend
most of her time out of doors. At the moment, she
realised that it was an exhilarating change, to have a
companion near her own age to stroll with through
the woods, and talk to. Oh, if she had only been
married to Lancelot Lumley! Into the emptiness of
her heart, there stole the inevitable temptations of
memory; but it was sinful to harbour such thoughts.
Well, at any rate, Lancelot had never actually asked
her to marry him&mdash;Hugo had&mdash;and so there it was.
And here she was&mdash;the most miserable young woman
within the four seas.</p>

<p>When Lumley had been at home for about a fortnight,
and his father&#8217;s health had somewhat improved,
he went over to see his relations the Dentons, and
stayed with them for two days. From them,
Mrs. Hesketh and Mrs. Fenchurch, he heard the real
truth, which had been so carefully withheld when he
had been on the spot: how Hugo Blagdon neglected
his wife, cut her off from all society, and spent most<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_197"></a>[197]</span>
of his time in London or Paris,&mdash;his excuse being that
she was but one degree removed from imbecility.</p>

<p>Perhaps it was indiscreet of Maude Hesketh to
relate the wrongs of her friend with such passionate
eloquence, for she fired the young man&#8217;s blood, and
he returned to the Rectory carrying with him a
smouldering heart. Why should not he pick up this
pearl that was trampled on by a swine?</p>

<p>Just at the time, that he returned, Hugo Blagdon
made one of his rare appearances. He entered the
drawing-room to discover Lumley and his wife at
tea. Lumley had come to tell her about his visit, and
bring messages and all the latest news from Thornby.
Amazing to relate Blagdon&#8217;s manner to the silent
young man, was cordial, and even effusive!&mdash;he talked
about mutual friends, sport, and the service&mdash;undaunted
by his guest&#8217;s frigidity&mdash;and said:</p>

<p>&#8220;I am not much here myself&mdash;the place doesn&#8217;t
agree with me.&#8221; (This was a new excuse invented on
the spot.) &#8220;But if you like to come up at any time
and shoot, I shall be glad. The rabbits want thinning,
and by and by there will be the partridges.&#8221;</p>

<p>He also invited Lumley to dine, but this he curtly
declined. Nothing would induce him to eat Blagdon&#8217;s
salt! The way in which he spoke to, and looked at
his wife, made him feel beside himself.</p>

<p>For two or three days Captain Lumley failed to
appear; then Mr. Blagdon&#8217;s head keeper went down
to the Rectory to see him, and announced his master
had gone away, and left orders that he was to have as<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_198"></a>[198]</span>
much shooting as he liked, and to make use of the guns
in the gun-room; and, in fact, that it would be a
favour more than otherwise to keep the game down.
All this was also mentioned in a civil note.</p>

<p>But Lancelot Lumley did not wish to shoot; he
wanted to see Blagdon&#8217;s wife, and walked up to Sharsley
that same afternoon. Mrs. Blagdon was in her room,
and sent a message to say that she had a headache
and was sorry she could not receive anyone. He felt
unreasonably disappointed, and wandered about the
place for hours&mdash;making use of his liberty to explore
the woods; and there, to his astonishment and hers&mdash;for
she supposed he had gone home&mdash;Letty met him
face to face in a walk in one of the plantations. She
started and exclaimed, as they came upon one another;
and now he understood <i>why</i> she had denied herself!
Mrs. Blagdon had a black eye, and her lip was cut
and swollen.</p>

<p>&#8220;I did not want you to see me,&#8221; she began nervously.
&#8220;I fell over a chair last night in the dark, and I&#8217;m
rather an object.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;What is the use of telling me that?&#8221; he answered
roughly; pity, deep concern for her, and blind fury
against Blagdon getting the better of him&mdash;&#8220;when I
know as well as <i>you</i> do, that your husband struck
you? Does he often do it?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Oh, don&#8217;t, don&#8217;t ask me,&#8221; she faltered; &#8220;let us
talk of other things&mdash;please never allude to this
again. Hugo has a temper&mdash;and I&mdash;I&mdash;irritate him.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;He is a brute!&#8221; declared Lumley, whose face had<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_199"></a>[199]</span>
grown white and stern. &#8220;The way he treats you is
notorious. <i>Why</i> do you stay with him?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;What else am I to do?&#8221; she asked piteously.
&#8220;I have no other home; I could not go to The Holt
now. Of course there is Hugo&#8217;s sister; but although
she is angry with him, and tells me I am a little fool,
yet she would never openly take my part against
her brother. No, there is no escape for me, I
must just live my life. Hugo hates me; over and
over again, he has told me that he wishes I were
dead!&#8221;</p>

<p>She sat down as she spoke, on a rustic seat, overcome
by her emotions, and losing her self-control,
buried her disfigured face in her hands. As Lumley
stood looking at her, he felt ready to offer his life
on the instant, and to fling his own plans and all
fortune&#8217;s chances to the winds; but he did not
attempt to soothe or console her; and she wept uninterruptedly
for some little time; then, as her sobs
ceased, and she became calmer, he said quietly,&mdash;though
inwardly shaken with agitation:</p>

<p>&#8220;Listen to me, Letty. There is an escape for you.
I have always loved you&mdash;yes&mdash;ever since the day
that you came to Thornby, and I first saw you;
you remember how we did the pulpit together, how
you gave your very first dance to <i>me</i>&mdash;you are the
only girl I ever cared about. I know this is a hackneyed
saying, but it is absolutely true. I had nothing to
marry on, nothing to offer you, but you were so young&mdash;barely
seventeen, and I thought I would <i>wait</i>. I<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_200"></a>[200]</span>
talked it over with my uncle, and asked if I might say
a word to you. He said it would be madness; that
you had no thought of&mdash;of&mdash;lovers, being a mere child,
and that the Fenchurchs would never consent to a
long engagement; then Blagdon saw you, and he
came and snatched away my treasure. If he had
made you happy, I could have forgiven him; but even
when you were a bride, I seemed to see clouds. I
return home, and I find that he treats you like a
brute! The coward knows, that you have no man to
protect you; no father or brother. Now what I want
to say is, will you come away with me?&mdash;I know it
sounds awful!&#8221;</p>

<p>She looked up at him with an expression of dismay,
and uttered an inarticulate gasp.</p>

<p>&#8220;But let me explain.&#8221; As he went on steadily,
the man&#8217;s self-reliance, instinct of possession and
authority, became evident. &#8220;You will travel up to
London and meet me there&mdash;only as a friend&mdash;leaving
a letter for Blagdon. Tell him the truth. Tell him,
you have gone away with <i>me</i>. I will not attempt to
defend the suit. I shall leave England for six months,
and at the end of that time return, and marry you.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;And what about Cara?&#8221; she asked abruptly.</p>

<p>&#8220;You must leave the child here. I suppose Blagdon
would hardly ill-treat an infant of that age; and no
doubt his sister would receive her. Perhaps you might
be allowed to keep her? I don&#8217;t know much about
these sort of things. I only know, that I want you to
break your bonds, and get a new start in life. Why<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_201"></a>[201]</span>
you are barely twenty!&mdash;think of the fifty years that
lie before you,&mdash;and have pity upon yourself!&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;To escape from Hugo&mdash;never to see him again&mdash;never
to hear his voice, to meet his eyes, would be, oh,
such overwhelming joy&mdash;such a relief! You cannot
think how much I am afraid of him; sometimes he is
like a lunatic, and I am terrified to be with him alone;
and yet what can I do? How can <i>anyone</i> come
between us&mdash;I am his wife.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;<i>I</i> will come between you,&#8221; said the young man
resolutely, &#8220;that is, if you care for me, Letty?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Yes I do; I&#8217;ve always cared,&#8221; she answered, in a
tremulous voice. &#8220;But think of your father and
Frances, my greatest friend, and Maudie Hesketh, and
little Cara, to have a mother who ran away&mdash;and oh,
imagine what all the people around would say!&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;The people around would say, that they were
astonished that you didn&#8217;t make your escape years
ago. Cara is but an infant, she will have her <i>own</i> life,
she is the daughter of a rich man; you are not called
upon to sacrifice the whole of your existence to her;
<i>you</i> have a right to live, as much as she has! Mrs.
Fenchurch will be shocked&mdash;that I grant you&mdash;but
that Maudie Hesketh and my sister will forgive you&mdash;I
guarantee.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;No, no, no, I never could do it&mdash;I beseech you
not to tempt me!&#8221; then without another word, she
suddenly turned into a side path, and actually ran
away. But although Letty had evaded him on this
occasion Lancelot Lumley would not relinquish his<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_202"></a>[202]</span>
intention; he knew what he was doing; he took into
consideration all the scandal, the talk, and the injury
that it would cause him in his profession. On the
other hand, he thought of Letty: they would be so
happy together, and ultimately they would live it
down!</p>

<p>He wrote her a clear, urgent, and impassioned
letter, putting everything plainly before her, and
imploring her to leave home.</p>

<p>&#8220;For six months after the divorce you could live in
some quiet seaside or country place, or in Switzerland.
I have ample money to provide for this. I will of
course not see you, and I shall apply for an exchange
to a battalion in India; when the decree nisi is pronounced,
all our troubles will be over, and like the
people in the fairy tale, we shall live happy ever after.&#8221;</p>

<p>Before the end of the week, they had met again;
and the force of fear and love, and Lumley&#8217;s eloquent
persuasion ultimately carried the day; but during
this week, Letty had lived in a palsy of indecision,
painfully conscious of the debility of her own will.
One moment, she had made up her mind, the next
she changed it; however, after a decisive interview,
in which Lumley said, &#8220;It must be yes or no&mdash;<i>now</i>&mdash;for
I am going away,&#8221; with a white face and trembling
lips, Letty had breathed the syllable &#8216;Yes.&#8217;</p>

<h2 class="nobreak">CHAPTER XIX</h2>
</div>


<p class="drop-cap">IT had been arranged by Captain Lumley that he
was to go to London, where, by a certain train and
on a certain day, he would be joined by Mrs. Blagdon.
In this short breathing-space Letty had much to
think of, and accomplish. She collected, sorted, and
packed some clothes, and a few treasured personal
belongings; but abandoned all her jewellery, except
one or two trifling ornaments, a string of pearls, and
her uncle&#8217;s diamond heart, destroyed the whole of her
innocent correspondence, put the photograph of her
wedding group into the waste-paper basket in four
pieces, and, heaviest task of all, set about writing letters
to her aunt, to Frances, and to Maude Hesketh. To
her she said:</p>

<p>&#8220;I know that you alone realise the awful life I have
led since my marriage, and will pity and forgive me.
I never see you now, and I am shut away from all the
world&mdash;not a wife, but a prisoner. Sometimes last
winter when Frances and her father were at Bournemouth,
I was afraid that my mind would have
given way; the loneliness and monotony seemed to
deaden my brain. Dear Cousin Maudie, do not think
too badly of me, and love me still.&#8221;</p>

<p>The leave-taking epistle destined for her husband,<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_204"></a>[204]</span>
was a more difficult task; how many sheets of paper
were destroyed, before she had succeeded to her
satisfaction!</p>

<p>Waggett the nurse had an inarticulate understanding
with her master, and all this packing, letter-writing,
and hours of weeping in the nursery, excited her suspicions,&mdash;and
could mean but one thing. When Cara
was asleep, Miss Waggett slipped down to the village
post office and sent a telegram to Mr. Blagdon&#8217;s London
address, which said, &#8216;Your presence required urgently.&#8217;</p>

<p>Blagdon, who was on the eve of a trip to Paris, returned
by the first train&mdash;actually passing his wife on
her flight to London. When, in a ferocious temper, he
arrived at Sharsley, he was informed that Mrs. Blagdon
was not at home, had left at twelve o&#8217;clock in the
village fly, taking luggage with her. Then a letter
addressed to him was produced; it had been placed in
a conspicuous position on the smoking-room chimney-piece.</p>

<p>He snatched this from the old man-servant&#8217;s hand,
tearing it open as he walked away; then, glancing over
it, he slapped his great thigh and exclaimed exultantly:</p>

<p>&#8220;By Gad, she&#8217;s done it! She&#8217;s done it!&#8221;</p>

<p>The letter began:</p>

<div class="blockquot">
<p>
&#8220;<span class="smcap">Hugo</span>,<br />
</p>

<p>&#8220;I am to-day leaving this house for ever. To
me it has been a miserable home. I can no longer
endure your neglect and cruelty. I am going to
Lancelot Lumley, and you are free to take any steps<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_205"></a>[205]</span>
you please. I shall be thankful to be released from
you, and you, I know, will be glad to be rid of me,
since you have so often told me that you wished I were
dead. Well, in future we shall be dead to one another.
I need not ask you to be good to Cara; it breaks my
heart to leave her, but it breaks my heart to stay.</p>

<p class="right">&#8220;<span class="smcap">Letty.</span>&#8221;</p></div>

<p>&#8220;By Gad!&#8221; he repeated, &#8220;this is great news!
Dead to me&mdash;I should say so, the little puling fool!&#8221;</p>

<p>In a condition of supreme satisfaction he went to his
writing-table and filled a number of telegraph forms:
one of these was a long one to his lawyer, others were
addressed to his mother, his sister, and to several of
his chief friends. In short, a dozen wires carrying
the startling news were promptly despatched from
Sharsley Post Office.</p>

<p>(The intelligence was received in various fashions.
Mrs. Blagdon wept and kept her room: she was growing
old and feeble; Lady Rashleigh said, &#8220;Hullo! here
is a nice business! Letty has bolted with Captain
Lumley. I wouldn&#8217;t have believed she had it in
her!&#8221; and Lord Robert who was present, shouted
his usual ejaculation, &#8216;My hat!&#8217;)</p>

<p>When this task had been accomplished, Mr. Blagdon
drained a four-finger whisky and soda, and summoned
the housekeeper to his presence.</p>

<p>Bates appeared, was much on the <i>qui vive</i>, the impression
that something had happened was obvious to
the whole household.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_206"></a>[206]</span>&#8220;Bates,&#8221; he began, &#8220;Mrs. Blagdon has&mdash;er&mdash;left
here, and is never to be admitted to this house again.
I shall probably close it before long. You can put
away all the linen and china and that sort of thing,
and pack off the cook.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Yes, sir, excuse me, but it&#8217;s not a cook we have,
but a kitchenmaid. We are terribly short-handed,
only old Jenkins for man-servant, a boy for the knives,
and one housemaid. The big rooms are all in an awful
state of dust, and with them old tapestries and pictures,
and moth and damp, I expect there&#8217;s a lot of
damage already. We had no fires last winter&mdash;and&mdash;&mdash;&#8221;</p>

<p>At this point, the voice of her complaint was interrupted
by a succession of piercing screams immediately
on the other side of the door.</p>

<p>&#8220;It&#8217;s only Miss Cara,&#8221; explained Bates reassuringly;
&#8220;she is just in from her walk.&#8221;</p>

<p>Miss Cara&#8217;s papa rose from his chair and hastily
entered the hall, where he beheld Waggett, struggling
with an animated bundle of white embroidery and
bare legs, which had cast itself down upon the marble
flags, and was rending the air with uncontrolled shrieks,
and even squeals of passion.</p>

<p>&#8220;What&#8217;s all this?&#8221; he demanded peremptorily.</p>

<p>The child ceased her cries, raised her tearless face,
and stared at him threateningly.</p>

<p>&#8220;I want my mummy!&#8221; she shouted. &#8220;I want my
own mummy!&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Your mummy isn&#8217;t here&mdash;be quiet this moment.&#8221;</p>



<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_207"></a>[207]</span>A defiant yell was Cara&#8217;s sole answer.</p>

<p>&#8220;Shut up&mdash;shut up at once, you little devil! Do
you hear me?&#8221; and her father reached down, and
shook her roughly by the arm.</p>

<p>Cara surveyed him with a pair of rebellious blue
eyes, then drew in her breath and screamed with a
deafening increase of shrill and reckless fury. Such
were her efforts, that her little face was actually purple
and congested, as she drummed on the marble pavement
with the heels of her best shoes.</p>

<p>&#8220;Go &#8217;way!&#8221; she panted. &#8220;Go &#8217;way&mdash;ugly man&mdash;I
want my mummy!&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;<i>I</i> know what you want, and what you&#8217;ll get!&#8221;
cried her father, beside himself with anger, and snatching
her up, he proceeded to administer to the astonished
Cara, a first and ruthless chastisement: carrying out the
punishment with the broad palm of a powerful hand
in loud and resounding smacks.</p>

<p>The subject was so completely dazed by the experience
she had almost ceased to cry, merely ejaculating:</p>

<p>&#8220;Bad man! Bad man! Bad man!&#8221;</p>

<p>Meanwhile Nurse Waggett stood by, the embodiment
of complacent satisfaction, till, at a sign from
the executioner, she took over her gasping, sobbing,
bewildered charge, and carried her off to her own apartments.
Subsequently the threat, &#8220;I&#8217;ll bring your
<i>father</i>!&#8221; had a magical effect upon Miss Caroline
Blagdon: he remained an ineffaceable impression of
awe and terror, for many and many a day.</p>

<p>The news of &#8216;the break-up at the Court,&#8217; as it was<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_208"></a>[208]</span>
called, was all over the village by eight o&#8217;clock that
night; women ran into one another&#8217;s houses with
&#8216;Have you heard?&#8217; Men discussed the matter over
their half-pints at the &#8216;New Plough,&#8217; and the general
verdict was, that &#8220;the poor young lady had led a worse
than dog&#8217;s life, and <i>he</i> had been rightly served.&#8221;</p>

<h2 class="nobreak">CHAPTER XX</h2>
</div>


<p class="drop-cap2">AND now to accompany the fugitive to London.
At first, the mere novelty of a drive to the station
that delicious June day, and the unaccustomed
journey in the train filled her with a sense of
overpowering freedom; but as the heavy express
thundered along, her mind, as usual, began to be
uneasy and undecided; her thoughts turned insistently
to her deserted baby girl, and the more
she reflected, the more she felt drawn to Cara&mdash;and
by her very heart-strings!</p>

<p>When Mrs. Blagdon stepped out on the London
platform, it was a woebegone young woman, with a
white and frightened face, that encountered the glad
eyes of her awaiting lover,&mdash;who instantly recognised
that his beloved had recently passed through some
great emotional storm, and that her courage had been
sorely shaken by this, the most daring venture of her
existence. Here was a different Letty to the one who had
danced with him so gaily at the Brakesby Ball, and
skimmed over the ice on Batley Mere; <i>she</i> was a girl
radiant with youth and expectant happiness, looking
out on the future with brave and shining eyes. This
Letty, with her pathetic expression and tremulous
lips, recalled some poor wild bird with a broken wing,<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_210"></a>[210]</span>
and he realised that he must treat her with extraordinary
tact and tenderness.</p>

<p>They went together in search of her luggage, which
turned out to be of surprisingly modest dimensions,
and in keeping with its owner&#8217;s costume. Wearing a
simple white linen and a plain shady hat, Letty might
be the daughter of a curate, or a clerk, instead of the
wife of a fabulously wealthy man; but her companion
understood; she wished to leave Blagdon as she had
gone to him&mdash;empty handed. With a lover&#8217;s memory,
he recognised her little turquoise brooch, and a certain
thin, old-fashioned locket.</p>

<p>In a few minutes the pair were in a hansom threading
their way to the Cosmopolitan. Letty, sitting very
far back in her corner, with a rigid profile and tightly
clasped hands. It was more than two years since she
had been in London, and the noise, the traffic, the
varied sights, and the jostling crowds, struck her in
forcible contrast to the silence and emptiness of the
country.</p>

<p>After a long and sensitive silence, Lumley said:</p>

<p>&#8220;Letty, you look terribly pale and tired. I am
afraid you feel knocked up?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;No, no, I&#8217;m not tired,&#8221; she answered; &#8220;but so
thirsty, I can scarcely speak.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;We will have tea the moment we get to the hotel.
It&#8217;s just half-past five now. I&#8217;ve taken rooms there.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Rooms,&#8221; she repeated, looking at him with a
vacant gaze.</p>

<p>&#8220;Yes; in my name, and what will one day be yours,&#8221;<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_211"></a>[211]</span>
and he lifted one of her hands and kissed it. &#8220;Rooms
for Captain and Mrs. Lumley.&#8221;</p>

<p>The future Mrs. Lumley dragged away her hand, and
made no reply; her face flamed, no one could call her
pale now.</p>

<p>&#8220;Letty Lumley goes rather well,&#8221; continued her
companion, unabashed; &#8220;and here we are&mdash;come
along!&#8221; helping her out; then proceeding up the
steps he ushered her into the entrance of the hotel.
They passed through a great hall, entered a spacious
lift, and were whirled to the first floor, where they were
evidently expected. A ready man-servant came forward
with (as it seemed to the lady) significant <i>empressement</i>,
and threw open the door of a lofty sitting-room,
furnished with heavy silk curtains, tall mirrors
between the windows, a soft dark carpet, Oriental vases,
cabinets, lounges, and luxurious chairs. A formal, expensive
apartment, somewhat stiff and gloomy, but
made beautiful with flowers.</p>

<p>&#8220;All the flowers you like best, Letty,&#8221; explained
Lumley, as the man departed with an order for
tea, &#8220;every one of your favourites, to bid you
welcome.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Yes, lovely,&#8221; she faltered. &#8220;How&mdash;thoughtful of
you!&#8221; and she buried her face in a great bowl of roses
and carnations. How, she asked herself, was she,
the coward of cowards, to tell Lancelot the truth?
She raised her eyes, and was confronted by a Chinese
incense burner; a monster in bronze, a sort of demon
dog, with a high spiral tail, and a flat, diabolical head,<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_212"></a>[212]</span>
which confronted her on an opposite cabinet, with a
hideous grin.</p>

<p>The bronze demon, as if alive and malignant,
appeared to mock her, and say:</p>

<p>&#8220;You know you cannot do it, you little born fool!&#8221;</p>

<p>She turned away, and looked out of the window,
with misty eyes and a fluttering heart&mdash;aware that,
her life had reached a desperate climax!</p>

<p>How could she tell Lancelot, so loyal, so chivalrous,
and devoted, that she had changed her mind in the
train, and was determined to return to Cara by the
half-past eight express?</p>

<p>In spite of her most determined efforts, tears dropped
on her blouse, and Lancelot, who had been anxiously
watching her, drew her tenderly towards him, and as
she sobbed on his shoulder said, &#8216;There, there, there!&#8217;
as if he were comforting a child. Steel herself
against her lover as she might, his presence affected
her deeply.</p>

<p>&#8220;I understand <i>all</i> about it&mdash;this has been an awful
wrench for you, a terrible day; but now you must
look forward, not backwards any more. The future is
ours, and I have ever so much to say to you.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;And I to you,&#8221; she murmured, drawing away from
him, and drying her eyes as she spoke. She glanced
nervously about the room&mdash;a room to be imprinted on
her memory as long as memory existed: for here she
must part with Lancelot, and for ever. It would be,
so to speak, a chamber of death, and at the thought
she shuddered. How morbid she was growing, or was<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_213"></a>[213]</span>
she a little mad? There was that grinning devil confronting
her, with wide-open jaws, flattened ears, and
staring eyes, and the background of this lofty,
heavily furnished apartment seemed to weigh upon her
senses; the perfume of the roses to stifle her.</p>

<p>&#8220;Here is tea,&#8221; announced Captain Lumley. &#8220;Shall
I pour it out and bring it over to you?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;No, no, thank you,&#8221; rising and taking off her
gloves; &#8220;but if you would open the windows?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Won&#8217;t you take your hat off?&#8221;</p>

<p>She hesitated for a moment and murmured:</p>

<p>&#8220;My hair is so untidy.&#8221;</p>

<p>But ultimately unpinned her hat, and threw it on a
sofa; it would not take long to put on again.</p>

<p>Then she sat down and began to busy herself with
the cups and saucers, and her companion noticed how
her hand was shaking. The buoyancy of his spirits
was by this time somewhat crushed. Letty was taking
it hardly; she was so sensitive. But after she had
had tea, and was a little refreshed, they would discuss
their plans; meanwhile he would talk any nonsense
to amuse and distract her.</p>

<p>&#8220;This is a fine room,&#8221; he said, looking about, &#8220;and
an A1 hotel. Did Frances ever tell you about Cousin
Toby and his bride? No? Well, he and Rosa funked
the honeymoon abroad; it was winter, and they
wanted to stay in town and do theatres and have a
good time; but, of course, their relations, who were
in London, barred it&mdash;said they must do the orthodox
thing. However, the two laid their plans, were seen<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_214"></a>[214]</span>
off at Victoria with due pomp, got out at Cannon
Street, and sneaked back here in great glee, and would
never have been found out but for Rosa&#8217;s umbrella;
it was full of rice and dripped grains all over the stairs
and place. The poor innocents never knew, till they
saw themselves among the fashionable arrivals; but,
I say, Letty, you&#8217;ve eaten nothing! Do have some of
these strawberries?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;No, no, thank you.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Feel better after your tea?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Yes; I was so thirsty, and my head ached; but
now I&#8217;m all right.&#8221; She put up her hands to her
beautiful hair, and he noticed that she was still wearing
her wedding ring.</p>

<p>&#8220;Well, now shall I explain things a little, or will
you talk first?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Do you please begin.&#8221; (Anything for a respite.)</p>

<p>&#8220;Then may I have a cigarette?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Of course you may.&#8221;</p>

<p>Lumley rose and took out his case, and began to walk
restlessly about the room; he was one of those men
who rarely sit down.</p>

<p>&#8220;I&#8217;ve arranged matters all right; seen our man of
business, Ross, and had a tremendous jaw with him.&#8221;
(He did not mention what a strenuous interview it had
been, and how the old family lawyer had exhausted his
wit, his eloquence, and his temper, in endeavouring,
as he hoped, to turn the young idiot from his folly;
from rushing headlong into social and professional
extinction.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_215"></a>[215]</span>The idea of young Lumley, whom he had known as
a remarkably bright, clever, steady boy, running off
with a married woman,&mdash;the wife, too, of such a
well-known character as Hugo Blagdon! What, he
asked him, would his father and sister say? And
how could he take a divorced wife into his regiment?</p>

<p>But it had all been a useless waste of brain tissue,
breath, and temper.)</p>

<p>&#8220;It will be plain-sailing, Letty, now we have burned
our boats; perhaps we had better dine downstairs, so
as to be <i>seen</i> together on account of the case.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;No, no, no,&#8221; half rising, and looking at him with a
startled expression.</p>

<p>&#8220;But, my darling Letty, unless you are divorced, how
can you marry me? We must give some just cause,
for them to go on; I&#8217;m not sure that it&#8217;s cricket&mdash;a
faked elopement&mdash;but I see nothing else for it; and I
understand there is no getting over the fact of a private
sitting-room: so I&#8217;ve taken this,&#8221; nodding at himself
in one of the long mirrors between the windows. &#8220;To-night,
I shall return to my own diggings, and you will
have the suite to yourself. To-morrow, we will go
down to Broadstairs, I&#8217;ve secured rooms for you there.
I&#8217;m afraid we won&#8217;t see much of one another till the
decree nisi is out; the case, of course, will be undefended;
our lawyers will arrange matters very quietly
and try and keep the business out of the papers. We
shall have to wait six months, and then, Letty,&#8221; and
his voice had a ring of irrepressible joy, &#8220;we will be
married!&#8221;</p>



<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_216"></a>[216]</span>Letty attempted to speak, but he put up his hand.</p>

<p>&#8220;Of course, it&#8217;s a maddening wait, but can&#8217;t be
helped. I&#8217;m going to Moscow to study Russian all the
time, and I&#8217;ll write to you every day, and you to me.
You might go abroad if you liked. Mrs. Hesketh has
promised me to befriend you. I&#8217;ve been down to see
her; she blames herself for <i>this</i>, says she brought us
together&mdash;not much bringing wanted on my part, eh,
Letty?&#8221; And he paused and laughed, a short excited
laugh.</p>

<p>&#8220;And what about&mdash;&mdash;&#8221; she was beginning.</p>

<p>&#8220;Just wait one second, till I finish my innings; I&#8217;m
wound up like a clock. Oh, yes, I know&mdash;the regiment.
I&#8217;ve arranged for an exchange to another in India&mdash;that&#8217;s
settled, and it is all right about money, too.
Did you hear that I came in for a legacy this spring.
I have enough for us both; to-morrow, I&#8217;ll open an
account for you at Cox&#8217;s. This is only the bald,
commonplace outline&mdash;and now,&#8221; coming to a standstill
before her, &#8220;I&#8217;ve finished at last, and it&#8217;s your
turn. What,&#8221; he asked with a smile, &#8220;have <i>you</i> got
to say?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I&#8217;ve got to say,&#8221; and she rose and faced him with
a face white as death, &#8220;that&mdash;that&mdash;I cannot&mdash;do it!
No,&#8221; speaking with dry lips, &#8220;it&#8217;s no use&mdash;my heart
has failed me, and <i>I am&mdash;going back</i>.&#8221;</p>

<p>Lumley&#8217;s amazement was such, that he was dumb;
twice he opened his mouth to speak, but only his
breathing could be heard. At last he stammered out:</p>

<p>&#8220;Letty, you are not in earnest,&mdash;you cannot return;<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_217"></a>[217]</span>
the worst is over, and I shall never let you go&mdash;never;
consider that settled.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Oh, but you must&mdash;you must!&#8221; she cried, twisting
her hands together. &#8220;I screwed up my courage&mdash;I
wrote those farewell letters&mdash;I wrote to him, and I left
home&mdash;it seems years ago; but before I was half-way
to town I had repented. Yes,&#8221; speaking between short
dry sobs, &#8220;you know my besetting failing; always
standing at the cross roads. This time, I have made
up my mind&mdash;I am,&#8221; and she gave a great sob,
&#8220;sure of myself. I love you, dear, dear Lancelot,
but if we carried out your plans, we should be
miserable.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;No we shouldn&#8217;t,&#8221; he broke in with hasty
emphasis; &#8220;on the contrary, for the first time for
years, you will know what it is to be free and young
and happy; you will live like others of your own age,
and enjoy a little sunshine.&#8221;</p>

<p>Looking at Letty as she stood with her back to the
window, it seemed incredible that this slim young girl,
was already a wife and mother.</p>

<p>&#8220;The sun, you mean, would never shine on <i>me</i>,&#8221; she
replied. &#8220;All the time I would be thinking of Cara,
wearying to see her, and feeling the most terrible
remorse. Is there anything in the whole world, that
can hurt like that?&#8221;</p>

<p>Lumley made no reply, he was struggling hard to
keep his emotion well under control, and she continued
tremulously:</p>

<p>&#8220;No one will ever know of this madness of mine&mdash;no<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_218"></a>[218]</span>
one but you. Hugo does not come to Sharsley for
months and months; as soon as I get back, I&#8217;ll destroy
my letter to him, the others as well&mdash;they were to be
posted to-morrow. There&#8217;s the mail-train at half-past
eight, and I shall easily catch it.&#8221;</p>

<p>As she concluded, she picked up her hat, and put it
on mechanically.</p>

<p>Meanwhile Lumley stood listening to her, watching
her keenly, and assuring himself that in the coming
struggle between two wills, the victory <i>must</i> go to the
strong.</p>

<p>&#8220;I am pleading as much for your sake as mine,&#8221; she
resumed, looking at him with wistful dignity, and not
a little daunted by his continued silence.</p>

<p>&#8220;Think of your poor father, who is so proud of you;
think of Frances, who is devoted to you&mdash;and to me.
Think of my poor little Cara, that I would be deserting
for ever.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;It is too late to talk of these things now, Letty,&#8221;
he answered inflexibly. &#8220;How can you suggest returning
to a fellow that deserts you, and treats you
brutally and cruelly; a man that you regard with
shuddering repulsion?&#8221; He was resolved to hit
hard.</p>

<p>&#8220;Oh, Lancelot, don&#8217;t!&#8221; wincing and turning away;
&#8220;if you only knew. I&#8217;d go with you to the world&#8217;s
end&mdash;I would&mdash;but for the child. Yes; in spite
of your father&#8217;s grey hairs, and your sister&#8217;s confidence
and affection; but there is something that I
cannot explain, and that you would not understand; it<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_219"></a>[219]</span>
is the <i>mother</i> in me, that is drawing me back&mdash;yes, and
I am going.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;No!&#8221; said Lumley suddenly, walking across the
room, and placing his back against the door. &#8220;You
don&#8217;t leave London to-night&mdash;talk of madness&mdash;that
would be madness indeed!&#8221;</p>

<p>His face looked stern and very pale; he had braced
himself as for a life and death struggle.</p>

<p>&#8220;Yes, I will prevent you, and by all means in my
power, short of force. <i>I</i> know what is best for you;
I am not thinking of myself,&mdash;but of you, now. You
know I love you too well, Letty, to do anything that
would harm you&mdash;but to allow you to escape to that
life of misery, would be a crime. A crime, against your
youth and your happiness; you talk of Cara, what is
she but a baby of three, and you are one-and-twenty?
Why is she to devour the whole of your future? She is
pretty, she is a rich man&#8217;s daughter, as far as I could
judge, has a strong will; the world will go well with
<i>her</i>. Suppose you sacrifice yourself, will she give up
her best years to you, and are <i>you</i> to have no life of
your own? As it is, you are like some beautiful flower
that has been kept in a dark room till its colour has
been bleached, and its vitality is perishing. If this
existence continues, what will you be in twenty years?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;<i>Dead</i>, I hope,&#8221; she answered sharply, then with a
flash of unexpected passion, &#8220;but dead or alive, I
am going to stick to Cara.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;No you are not,&#8221; he rejoined with gathering excitement.
&#8220;You are going to stick to <i>me</i>, and till death<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_220"></a>[220]</span>
us do part.&#8221; Visibly shaken by the force of his own
speech, he added hoarsely: &#8220;Letty, you have escaped
from bondage, be thankful for your freedom!&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;It is for you, Lancelot, to release me,&#8221; she
declared, &#8220;and help me to escape from here; from
a situation that will bring disgrace on me&mdash;and mine.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Do you mean that?&#8221; he demanded fiercely,
leaving his post, and coming a step nearer.</p>

<p>&#8220;Yes, I do,&#8221; she assented with a set wooden face,&mdash;the
face of a woman of double her age. &#8220;Lancelot, let
me pass. If you stand in my way, and prevent my
returning home I&mdash;I&mdash;swear I will never forgive you.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;If I had stood in your way four years ago, as I
ought to have done&mdash;my home would be yours. If I
let you pass <i>now</i>, I know, that I shall never set eyes
on you again.&#8221;</p>

<p>His handsome tanned face had taken a curious clay-coloured
shade; little drops of sweat stood on his
forehead.</p>

<p>&#8220;Think again, for God&#8217;s sake!&#8221; His voice rose,
vibrating with passion. &#8220;Have mercy on yourself.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Myself! No; <i>I</i> don&#8217;t count!&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Nor I? Letty, has it occurred to you, what an
awful fool you have made of me?&#8221;</p>

<p>It was true; she had sacrificed him as pitilessly as
herself&mdash;this only struck her now. For her sake
Lancelot had given up his regiment, thrown his prospects
to the winds, risked the loss of his friends.</p>

<p>&#8220;I know,&#8221; she stammered at last, &#8220;I have cost
you a great deal&mdash;far, far, too much. Lancelot, I&#8217;m not<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_221"></a>[221]</span>
<i>worth</i> it! I am a miserable, cowardly, half-hearted
creature&mdash;and now&mdash;let me go&mdash;oh <i>do</i>&mdash;I implore
you, let me go!&#8221;</p>

<p>As they stood staring into one another&#8217;s eyes, a
languid gilt clock on the mantel-piece, struck eight.</p>

<p>Lumley started, their discussion had absorbed more
time than seemed possible&mdash;he moved aside and said
in a muffled tone, &#8220;Well&mdash;if you must&mdash;you must!&#8221;</p>

<p>Letty came closer to him&mdash;his drawn stricken face
affected her profoundly. She seized his hand in both
of hers, and suddenly broke down.</p>

<p>&#8220;Good-bye, Lancelot; good-bye,&#8221; she sobbed
hysterically. &#8220;I know you will despise me, and
forget me; but as long as I live I shall love you,
better than anyone in the whole world&mdash;better than
Cara. But my duty is to her; if I went with you,
I should always, always, be looking back.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Poor Letty, I&#8217;ll try, and forgive you,&#8221; he
answered huskily; &#8220;but from the bottom of my
heart, I believe you are spoiling two lives; and the
day may come, when you will find it hard to
forgive yourself,&#8221; and with a violent wrench he
opened the door.</p>

<p>It was a strangely pale and agitated couple who
descended into the great hall, and a few minutes later
drove away to the station: a waiter going into the
empty room, found too late, that the lady had
forgotten a very damp pocket-handkerchief, and a
handsome umbrella with a gold handle, on which
was inscribed, &#8220;Mrs. Blagdon, Sharsley Court.&#8221;</p>



<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_222"></a>[222]</span>On their way down Piccadilly Captain Lumley and
his companion encountered a steady stream of hansoms
carrying their gay fares to dinners or the theatres.
The two, who held one another&#8217;s hands in agonised
silence, seemed to be journeying away from life, and
all its joys, and facing together&mdash;a dark and hopeless
future.</p>

<p>As soon as Letty had secured her ticket she said:</p>

<p>&#8220;We will say good-bye now, Lancelot&mdash;please don&#8217;t
come on the platform. You know this is the fast
train&mdash;and I may meet neighbours.&#8221;</p>

<p>And there, under the flaming lamps, in the ugly,
bare booking-office, came to these, who were so much
to one another, that transcendent moment of a
miserable and silent farewell. As Letty looked up into
her lover&#8217;s face, her heart felt a piercing stab; she
had once encountered a poor lost dog, with the self-same
expression in its eyes.</p>

<p>A moment later, she was hurrying along the platform,
asking for the train to Ridgefield.</p>

<p>&#8220;Sorry, miss,&#8221; replied an official, &#8220;but you&#8217;ve just
missed her,&#8221; indicating a round red light that was
vanishing into a tunnel; and the runaway had lost her
only opportunity of returning home that night! This
discovery was a shock: she felt vanquished&mdash;and half
distracted, but recovering her courage, and summoning
her wits to her assistance, she made over her luggage
to a porter, and departed in quest of a bedroom
in the Terminus Hotel.</p>

<h2 class="nobreak">CHAPTER XXI</h2>
</div>


<p class="drop-cap">MR. BLAGDON was a late riser; on this particular
morning it was eleven o&#8217;clock as he
stood lathering his great sensual face, in front of a
shaving-glass. The operation was but half completed,
when his valet entered, and, clearing his throat, said:</p>

<p>&#8220;Beg pardon, sir, but Mrs. Blagdon has just arrived
and is asking to see you.&#8221;</p>

<p>Blagdon&#8217;s somewhat shaky hand slipped, and gave
his chin a gash. When he had carefully plastered it
up, he turned to the man, with an alarming scowl.</p>

<p>&#8220;Jenkins didn&#8217;t let her in, did he?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Yes, sir, he did. She&#8217;s in the morning-room.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;That&#8217;ll do!&#8221; said his master in a voice of thunder,
and he continued his toilet with a determination that
he would sack Jenkins instantly, and turn his wife
out of the house. But before taking these drastic
steps, he must breakfast. He went heavily downstairs,
unfolding a large scented pocket-handkerchief, and
stalked into the dining-room; here he was served with
devilled kidneys, dry toast, and two strong whiskies
and sodas. Thus fortified, he approached with loud,
resonant footsteps, the morning-room, where the
culprit awaited him in shivering expectation: and
flinging the door wide, entered like an avenging fate.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_224"></a>[224]</span>&#8220;Well, ma&#8217;am, I shall be glad to know what the
devil brings <i>you</i> here?&#8221; he demanded. &#8220;The servants
had orders not to admit you. Old Jenkins shall be
kicked out to-morrow!&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Hugo,&#8221; she said, rising, and vainly endeavouring
to steady her voice, &#8220;of course, I know that after
the letter, which no doubt you have read, my coming
back like this must seem astonishing.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Outrageous! Scandalous!&#8221; he burst in. &#8220;Why,
it&#8217;s absolutely <i>shameless</i>!&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;But the truth is, before I got half-way to London
I had changed my mind. I found that I couldn&#8217;t leave
Cara, and so when I met Captain Lumley I told him
this, and in spite of all he could urge, I refused to take
the final step. We remained talking together too long,
and I just missed the last train&mdash;the mail. I had said
good-bye to him before that, and I went to the
station hotel and spent the night there, and came on
the first thing this morning. Hugo, I swear to you
that I am speaking the truth.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;What a fine cock-and-bull story!&#8221; he answered,
with a sneer. &#8220;We have heard of people missing
their trains before. I&#8217;m surprised that you and Lumley
between you, couldn&#8217;t think of something a little
<i>fresher</i>!&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;But you believe me, Hugo?&#8221; she implored, &#8220;and
I may come back?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;No, I&#8217;m damned if you shall! Come back, indeed!
I got your letter yesterday, and telegraphed at once
to my lawyer. You shall be, as you said yourself,<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_225"></a>[225]</span>
dead to me,&mdash;and I shall be dead to you. I am
not likely to put up with a woman who informs me
she is going off with a lover&mdash;and no doubt has a row
with him, finds she hasn&#8217;t bettered herself,&mdash;and
turns up at home the next day. By Jove, no!&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;But where am I to go?&#8221; she asked piteously.
&#8220;What am I to do? I swear to you, that I am as
innocent as Cara herself&mdash;at least, you will let me see
her?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Not I! And now, madam, we have had enough
of this,&#8221; and, taking her roughly by the arm, he led
her from the anteroom, out into the great hall,&mdash;the
door of which happened to be open. Without a word
he pushed her violently across the threshold, and
slammed the door upon her.</p>

<p>The fly and luggage had disappeared, there was
no one in sight, as the ejected wife went slowly down
the steps, and slowly down the avenue, as if she were
walking in her sleep; this unexpected blow had been
so staggering, that it momentarily stunned her.</p>

<p>Meanwhile Blagdon, with his hands in his pockets,
stood in the window of the hall, which commanded a
full view of the short entrance drive, his eyes fixed on
the receding figure. When he saw her approach and
pass through the great gates, making her final and
ignominious exit, he muttered under his breath,
&#8220;She&#8217;s <i>gone</i>!&#8221; and then he went back to the smoking-room,
selected one of his best cigars, and sat down
to meditate upon his future plans.</p>

<p>Frances Lumley, who happened to be crossing the<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_226"></a>[226]</span>
village square, halted when she beheld her friend.
What had happened? Why this white, stricken face?
She held out her hand, and enquired:</p>

<p>&#8220;Is anything the matter?&#8221;</p>

<p>For a moment the unhappy girl seemed to
choke; then&mdash;she stammered: &#8220;Yes&mdash;Hugo has
just turned me out of the house.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Turned you out! Oh, my poor Letty! Then you
will come home with me, of course?&#8221; And as she
spoke, she took her arm.</p>

<p>It was but a few yards to the Rectory, and as
they walked up the avenue, Letty halted abruptly,
and said:</p>

<p>&#8220;I don&#8217;t think I should come <i>here</i>,&#8221; releasing her
friend, and supporting herself by a railing that
bordered the drive.</p>

<p>&#8220;Nonsense!&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;But, Frances, you don&#8217;t know. It was because of
your brother that&mdash;that&mdash;Hugo has cast me off.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Because of <i>Lancelot</i>!&#8221; exclaimed Miss Lumley,
suddenly disconcerted; her colour rose, her eyes
dilated.</p>

<p>&#8220;Yes,&#8221; said Letty, and then&mdash;she added, in short,
gasping sentences: &#8220;I ran away to him yesterday to
London&mdash;but I changed my mind. I could not desert
Cara.&mdash;I came back. Hugo had returned suddenly,
and read my letter, and took me by the shoulders,
thrust me out, and slammed the door on me. I feel
sure he will try and divorce me!&#8221;</p>

<p>Frances&#8217; clear mind grasped a subject quickly. What<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_227"></a>[227]</span>
a disastrous affair for Lancelot! What was to be
done? Obviously the first step was to take Letty
into the house&mdash;she looked ghastly.</p>

<p>&#8220;Brother or no brother,&#8221; she said&mdash;stifling her own
dismay&mdash;&#8220;you must come and stay with us, and pull
yourself together. Matters may not be as bad as you
think.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;They are&mdash;and it&#8217;s all my fault. I have ruined
your brother, and disgraced myself, and Cara!&#8221;</p>

<p>This speech brought her into the Rectory door,
which stood wide, and she tottered into a chair in the
hall, and fainted away.</p>

<p>As soon as the refugee had been restored and put
to bed in the spare room, Frances, a woman of action,
wrote off to Mrs. Hesketh and to her brother, and
despatched a note to Bates at the Court with a request
for Mrs. Blagdon&#8217;s luggage. Then she proceeded to
explain matters to her invalid father, who was enchanted
to hear that Mrs. Blagdon was staying with
them&mdash;though he could not quite understand how it
was, that she should be in his house and not her own;
but his resourceful daughter satisfied his curiosity,
and told a lie, with the one simple word &#8216;Drains!&#8217;</p>

<p>Exhausted by bodily fatigue and mental emotion,
Letty slept soundly till the church clock, striking
nine, roused her from a sleep, that had bordered upon
stupor. Where was she? asked recovering consciousness.
The scene was strange, and beautiful&mdash;a wide-open
window, the perfume of flowers, above, in the
summer sky, a slim young moon. Was she dead, and<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_228"></a>[228]</span>
was this house Heaven? Suddenly, with a torrential
rush, black memory overwhelmed her.</p>

<p>During the next twenty-four hours, Frances Lumley
was all that a sister, and more than some sisters would
be, to the unhappy refugee. She consoled, soothed,
cheered her,&mdash;keeping her own tremors respecting
Lancelot entirely out of sight. Then Mrs. Hesketh
appeared upon the scene, and carried her friend away
to Oldcourt. Francie Lumley was a dear girl, with a
heart of gold, but it was not seemly that Mrs. Blagdon
should be her guest, with the case of Blagdon <i>v.</i>
Blagdon and Lumley, imminent in the Law Courts.</p>

<p>It soon became noised abroad that Blagdon was
about to divorce his wife, and mothers with daughters,
once more began to cast expectant eyes on Sharsley.</p>
<hr class="chap x-ebookmaker-drop" />

<div class="chapter">
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_229"></a>[229]</span>

<h2 class="nobreak">CHAPTER XXII</h2>
</div>


<p class="drop-cap">THE case of Blagdon <i>v.</i> Blagdon and Lumley
divided the County into factions and separated
chief friends. Some said, that <i>now</i> they thoroughly
understood why Blagdon was reluctant to produce his
wife in Society; obviously she was mentally unsound&mdash;a
woman who ran away, and returned to him the
next day! She had been a shy, odd creature from the
first. The opposition were violent partisans, and
declared that a girl so young, pretty, and innocent,
had been driven to desperation by the brutality of her
monster of a husband. It was a curious but not uncommon
circumstance, that most of the women took
the part of the man; whilst the men-folk, and in great
numbers, were solid for the lady.</p>

<p>Letty&#8217;s few relatives lived in Ireland, and were not a
little shocked to learn of her being mixed up in a scandal.
They hid the paper from their friends, and discussed
their black sheep in horrified whispers. The character
of Mr. Blagdon had not been wafted across the Irish sea.</p>

<p>When the newly married couple were in London,
one or two of the Irish clan had attempted to make
their cousin&#8217;s acquaintance&mdash;not because she had made
a great match, but that it was an opportunity of seeing
poor Dermot&#8217;s daughter, and blood is thicker than<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_230"></a>[230]</span>
water. However, their civil advances were rudely repulsed
by Hugo (who hated the Irish as a nation) and
did not want to be bothered with a pack of his wife&#8217;s
relatives; and they merely saw a heavy-browed, formidable
personage, and a pretty, shy girl with stiff
manners. And now this pretty, shy girl had come to
grief&mdash;wealth and importance had turned her silly
little head. It was a pity!</p>

<p>The Blagdon-Lumley case, was entirely circumstantial,
and the chain of evidence complete; the
petitioner, a wealthy man; no enterprising legal firm
came forward as a speculation to take up the co-respondent&#8217;s
side, and the suit was undefended. Lumley
had again repaired to Mr. Ross (Ross, Carbery &amp; Co.),
and told a plain, unvarnished tale, assuring them of the
lady&#8217;s innocence on his solemn word of honour. The
firm listened with agreeable sympathy, but declared,
that there was nothing to be done, but face the
consequences of an act of folly. Mrs. Blagdon had run
away from her husband, leaving a letter of confession;
she had joined their client in London openly, and left
the hotel in his company. It was true, that she had
repented, and next day presented herself at home in
the character of a reformed wife; but it wouldn&#8217;t do&mdash;no,
it would <i>not</i> do.</p>

<p>&#8220;I understand, that she is extraordinarily good-looking,&#8221;
added Mr. Ross, &#8220;and that might give her a
chance with the jury; but if you will take my advice,
Captain Lumley, and speaking in the character of a
friend, you will not attempt to defend the case. The<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_231"></a>[231]</span>
less mud-throwing the better&mdash;all can be arranged
between Mr. Blagdon&#8217;s lawyers and ourselves; at the
end of six months there will be the usual decree, and I
take it for granted, that you will marry the lady?&#8221;</p>

<p>But, as it happened, the lady absolutely refused to
marry Lumley. For some time she had been in a state
of collapse, under the roof and the care of her friend at
Oldcourt. She seemed to be in a dazed condition, her
recent experience appeared to have exercised an almost
paralysing effect on her thinking faculties, and when
she recovered, and was informed that the trial was
over, that Hugo had generously settled five hundred a
year upon her, and she was free to marry again; she
assured Maude Hesketh and Mrs. Denton that nothing
in the world would induce her to do so. No arguments
affected her, and she positively declined to see Lancelot
Lumley.</p>

<p>&#8220;I have done him enough harm as it is,&#8221; she pleaded,
&#8220;and I only hope he may forget me.&#8221;</p>

<p>So Captain Lumley went out to his new regiment,
which was quartered in Peshawur, with an empty
pocket, a sore heart, and a somewhat damaged reputation.</p>

<p>It is perhaps needless to mention, that Mrs. Fenchurch
did not spare the culprit when she came to Oldcourt to
visit and upbraid her. Letty sat listening and gazing
in helpless silence, whilst her aunt had her &#8216;<i>say</i>.&#8217;
After a vigorous arraignment of her conduct, and
her shameful abandonment of a splendid position,
she concluded:</p>



<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_232"></a>[232]</span>&#8220;I merely came to tell you, that I wash my hands
of you, Letty, and I am thankful that my poor dear
husband did not live to see this day. I have one piece
of advice to give you, and that is, that you marry
Captain Lumley. I believe he is ready to make you
his wife&mdash;go out to him in India, and remain there. I
understand that as Society in the East is only <i>too</i> well
accustomed to scandals and divorces, you will probably
be received, and enabled to make a fresh start. Thanks
to Hugo&#8217;s generosity, and with a captain&#8217;s Indian pay,
you will be quite comfortably off.&#8221;</p>

<p>To all this advice the inquisitor received no reply,
and rising red-faced from her seat, she added angrily:</p>

<p>&#8220;I see it&#8217;s no use talking to you for your good. You
are in one of your tempers. I <i>had</i> intended offering
you your uncle&#8217;s P. &amp; O. trunks; but I shall do <i>nothing</i>
further&mdash;good-bye!&#8221;</p>

<p>To the friendless divorc&eacute;e, Cousin Maude played the
part of a good and rich Samaritan. As it was winter
time she took her to the Riviera, but Letty still exhibited
a lack of energy and indifference to her surroundings,
which was disheartening to her companion; however,
by degrees, sunshine, peace, and youth had their effect,
and, as a crushed flower in water, she revived. Her
beauty and grace were remarkable. She had at last
&#8216;come into her own,&#8217; and was now a lovely girl&mdash;no
longer the pallid, cowed bride of four years previously.
Since then, she had experienced matrimony, misery,
love&mdash;real love&mdash;and disgrace; also the tardy realisation
of her own endowment.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_233"></a>[233]</span>If in former days, Blagdon was bitterly disappointed
by his wife&#8217;s insignificance, Mrs. Hesketh was now
proportionately amazed at her success; by the many
staring eyes that followed her companion, the &eacute;clat,
the sensation she created was quite remarkable&mdash;the
girl was much too conspicuous for a divorc&eacute;e in retreat.</p>

<p>Kind, generous Maude Hesketh, though sincerely
attached to her prot&eacute;g&eacute;e, was not without certain
human weaknesses. She was inclined to be pessimistic,
analytical, inquisitive, and occasionally a <i>little</i>
irritable. In her secret heart she felt both sore and
envious; she had been a notable beauty in her time,
and although she had never encouraged admirers, yet
was keenly alive to the homage of their eyes. To-day,
all these looks and whispers were for another; whilst
she was merely a well-preserved, elderly woman, to
whom no one threw a second glance. She had accepted
admiration as her right, and she now felt as if she had
lost her youth for a second time!</p>

<p>For good and sundry reasons, the two ladies kept
themselves in strict seclusion; they occupied a private
sitting-room, and went out in a private carriage with
a pair of capital horses. Now and then Mrs. Hesketh
came across acquaintances, who glanced interrogatively
at her graceful companion. As a rule she made
no introductions, but when these could not possibly
be avoided, she murmured the name of &#8220;Mrs.
Glyn.&#8221;</p>

<p>Among the other guests at the &#8220;Calafornie,&#8221; Cannes,
was a certain needy, worldly widow, Mrs. Plassy&mdash;Mrs.<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_234"></a>[234]</span>
Bolingbroke-Plassy with a lively daughter of two-and-twenty.</p>

<p>This widow, made valiant attempts to attach herself
to Mrs. Hesketh,&mdash;who was notoriously rich, had the
air of a duchess, and a charming landau at her disposal;
it was also known to her, that the most distinguished
people in Cannes had left cards upon this lady. But
Mrs. Hesketh&mdash;who could play the <i>grande dame</i> to perfection,
had &#8216;no use&#8217; for Mrs. Plassy, mistrusted her
worming civilities, her subdued flatteries, and kept
her inflexibly at arm&#8217;s length. The pretty companion
was more approachable (Letty could never repulse a
dog, much less a fellow-creature), and she and Miss
Plassy, drawn together by their youth, and tastes,
played tennis, and sang duets. The innocent soprano
little suspected how deeply and sincerely she was
hated by the contralto; she thought Lydia a pleasant,
lively, unaffected girl, and if her mother <i>was</i>, as
Cousin Maude declared, an inquisitive, marauding
&#8216;old soldier,&#8217; what harm did it do to anyone?</p>

<p>&#8216;The old soldier&#8217; had deeply resented Mrs. Hesketh&#8217;s
uncompromising repulse; her animosity was kindled,
and she instituted searching enquiries into the
lady&#8217;s career,&mdash;which proved to be blameless; but,
to her amazement, pretty, shrinking Mrs. Glyn, had a
very black record! The fact leaked out&mdash;through a
treacherous lady&#8217;s-maid&mdash;that this pretty girl was no
less a person than the notorious and divorced Mrs.
Blagdon! Fortunately the friends, were on the point
of departure for San Remo, for Mrs. Plassy mentioned<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_235"></a>[235]</span>
the discovery, as a dead secret, to every woman of her
acquaintance in the hotel,&mdash;and they all held up their
hands in speechless horror.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>At the end of six months Mrs. Hesketh returned
home, and by that time the great local scandal had
been succeeded by others, and was more or less forgotten.
Mr. Blagdon was said to be in America;
Captain Lumley was in India; no one knew the whereabouts
of the lady. She was living quietly in a country
town thirty miles south of London, occasionally spending
a few days at Oldcourt, but, on the whole, alone. To
occupy her time she had taken up music, and worked
hard; practising with a view to becoming a professional
singer. As Mrs. Glyn, a solitary, pretty young woman,
she made no acquaintances, with the exception of two
or three elderly women in the same hotel, who regarded
her as an interesting mystery; she could not be a
widow, since she wore no scrap of mourning&mdash;presumably
she had a husband,&mdash;but where? She kept
herself conspicuously aloof from other people,&mdash;and
why?</p>

<p>All the time, this much-discussed, unhappy stranger,
was filled with a simple human craving to see her
child again&mdash;to hold her in her arms. To have her
with her, had become a sort of obsession. At night as
she lay awake and weeping, she seemed to hear her
forsaken baby, forlorn and helpless, crying to her
across the darkness. She had sacrificed <i>all</i> for Cara&mdash;and
lost her!</p>

<h2 class="nobreak">CHAPTER XXIII</h2>
</div>


<p class="drop-cap">&#8216;MAYTHORNE,&#8217; where Mrs. Glyn&mdash;formerly Blagdon&mdash;had
hidden her diminished head, was a
fine old red-brick mansion standing in its own grounds
and meadows, and within thirty miles of London. Once
the family seat of a well-known banker, it was now the
successful investment of a syndicate, and a more or
less glorified hotel, boasting (in a not untruthful advertisement)
of its splendid situation, salubrious air,
far-famed gardens, comforts, and cows.</p>

<p>When Letty, fearing that her company was beginning
to irk her friend, and reluctant to return to Thornby,
had implored Mrs. Hesketh to find her a quiet haven,
Mrs. Hesketh&#8217;s friends, had recommended her to
Maythorne. In late spring and early summer, the
Maythorne guests were dull and commonplace:
various invalids, lame, blind, and halt, with their
nurses; girls or boys brought for change after the
usual measles or whooping cough; old maids and
widows; who knitted and gossiped and paced the
broad walks in couples, took tea in little coteries,
and devoted their evenings to cribbage, and patience.</p>

<p>To these, the arrival of a strikingly beautiful girl, a
married woman, alone, without even a maid, offered a
nice fresh topic for discussion. &#8216;Mrs. Glyn&#8217; looked<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_237"></a>[237]</span>
about nineteen, had a private sitting-room, and was
very reserved&mdash;but when addressed, discovered a sweet,
low voice, and timid manners. She had no visitors,
and there was rarely a letter for her in the hall rack.
Mrs. Glyn sang delightfully, and went twice to church
on Sundays; and this was all that could be found out.</p>

<p>By degrees, the stranger came to know various other
women, especially two of them&mdash;the oldest residents,
who made a point of speaking to everyone,&mdash;these were
friendly, and invited her to tea, and taught her &#8216;demon&#8217;
patience, and borrowed her <i>Spectator</i>; but Sister Sophy
and Sister Mary, were painfully inquisitive, and she was
not sufficiently subtle to evade their polite and insidious
enquiries,&mdash;or to avoid disaster in the cunning
pitfalls they so skilfully laid with regard to her &#8216;home.&#8217;
Letty instinctively felt, that her answers were unsatisfactory,
and withdrew from their society as imperceptibly
as she dared, contenting herself with the company
of the hotel dog, who attended her in her country walks,
and took tea with her most afternoons.</p>

<p>Maythorne was an irregular old house, renovated;
with white paint, modern furniture, and pretty chintz;
its ceilings were low, its stairs shallow, and in the long
passages were unexpected steps. Letty&#8217;s apartments
were detached, she had selected them on purpose,
that she might play and sing without disturbing her
neighbours.</p>

<p>Around the house were smooth lawns of turf, winding
paths and alleys among laurels and rhododendrons;
here and there a noble forest tree, and clumps of rose-trees,<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_238"></a>[238]</span>
and high delphiniums of a royal and dazzling blue,
and here Letty spent many an hour with a book, her
own thoughts, and the infatuated Toby. As June
melted into an unusually warm July, the number of
guests increased; day by day one noted new faces;
large family parties, father, mother, boys and girls,
who preferred the country, with golf, tennis, picnics,
and bicycling, to the seductions of the seaside. The
term of &#8216;week-end&#8217; had not yet been coined, but the
actual thing existed; and many city men ran down
from town from Friday to Monday for golf, fresh air,
and good country food. Maythorne had also a reputation
for &#8216;pretty girls.&#8217; By all accounts, there was a
wonderful beauty staying there now; she sat in a
niche near the far door and was alone. Also it was a
case of &#8216;paws off!&#8217; and the lady always got out of the
room before the dessert, and disappeared.</p>

<p>It was true Mrs. Glyn got out of the room &#8216;before
the dessert,&#8217; those staring eyes frightened her, and she
slipped away to a certain remote seat in the ground,&mdash;as
yet undiscovered by others,&mdash;and there contemplated
the undulating country, whose fresh green pastures,
dark woods, and delicate blue distances, seemed to
act as balm upon an open wound.</p>

<p>&#8220;But what <i>is</i> the good of it all?&#8221; she would murmur
(a phrase caught from Cousin Maude). Why had
she been born? where was her place in the world?
No wife, and no widow; her child taken from her; no
home, and but two friends, Frances and Cousin Maudie&mdash;an
encumbrance to both! Frances, the sister of<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_239"></a>[239]</span>
Lancelot, must know how she had spoiled her brother&#8217;s
life; how <i>could</i> she endure her? Cousin Maude, with
her self-centred existence (out of which her divorce had
figuratively torn her), had once more retreated into
her shell. School-fellows, Irish cousins, which of these
would venture to know her,&mdash;a divorc&eacute;e? And who
could blame them? She thought of the other girls
here: happy girls of her own age; from her nook, she
could hear gay voices and laughter on the croquet
ground, but she might not mix with them; the old
ladies had spoken&mdash;<i>they</i> could associate with her&mdash;not
so the young people.</p>

<p>Two girls, who happened to hear her singing, were entranced;
and eagerly made friends with the performer;
but when their portly mothers noticed them strolling in
the grounds, with Letty in the middle, animated, and
discoursing of music,&mdash;in answer to an imperative signal,
she found herself suddenly deserted. Mrs. Glyn was
not to be &#8216;known,&#8217; that was too painfully evident;
and the &#8216;mystery&#8217; walked on alone, holding her head
unusually high, acutely conscious that she was taboo!
and filled with an angry, straining against circumstances,
and against fate.</p>

<p>&#8220;She does look so pretty, and so innocent!&#8221; admitted
a wealthy matron, &#8220;and I admire her enormously
as a picture&mdash;not otherwise. These &#8216;butter-would-not-melt-in-my-mouth&#8217;
class are notoriously dangerous!&#8221;</p>

<p>To some of the men, Mrs. Glyn was naturally all
the more attractive, because of the ladies&#8217; veto; these<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_240"></a>[240]</span>
were only too anxious to cultivate her acquaintance,
but she shrank from their neighbourhood, and treated
their anxious overtures, with discouraging hauteur.
Although she had youth, beauty, health, and five
hundred a year, what, she asked herself, did it avail,
a woman with a past, and without hope, or future?
If she only had the necessary courage, she might
follow the example of a recent suicide, and scribble on
a card, &#8216;No home, no friends&mdash;Exit,&#8217; and then go
and drown herself; it would be a simple ending to all
her troubles, and her hopeless yearnings for Cara, and
for Lancelot. Her thoughts of him, were inexpressibly
painful, and tinged with acute remorse. Over and
over again, she recalled his stricken face, and stern
accusation, &#8220;Letty, you have made a fool of me,&#8221; and
this was true&mdash;a pitiless and unanswerable fact.</p>

<p>When the moon arose, and the bats began to flit about
the garden, the mysterious beauty would repair to her
own quarters, and there seek for sympathy in her piano.
She sang not only well-known songs, but verses she
had set to music. The air of one composition was
peculiarly sad and haunting, and two City men who
were strolling about together&mdash;discussing the market
prices&mdash;halted, attracted by a beautiful voice which
floated from an open window. As they stood, and
listened, this is what fell on their ears.</p>

<p>As the last words died away, one of the audience
gave himself a vigorous shake, carefully examined
his half-finished cigar, and exclaimed:</p>

<p>&#8220;By George! that young woman must be in a bad
way&mdash;eh? I wonder who she is? She is singing like
one of those sirens that bothered old what&#8217;s-his-name.
Shall we clap&mdash;eh?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;No,&#8221; with prompt emphasis, &#8220;the girl is singing&mdash;and
her voice is exquisite&mdash;like some unhappy soul
who has lost everything in the world.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Oh, Bosh! you and your romantic fancies! Come
along indoors and have a game of billiards. I&#8217;ll give
you twenty up! There will be no more songs,&mdash;see,
she has turned down the light.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;All right, I see,&#8221; agreed the man of sentiment,
as he reluctantly followed his challenger.</p>

<p>The morning after this incident, a letter from Frances
Lumley not only distracted Letty&#8217;s thoughts, but
carried her away from Maythorne. The stimulating
news, which was in the postscript, said:</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>&#8220;I have just heard that little Cara and her new
nurse have gone to Folkestone. The child had measles,<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_242"></a>[242]</span>
but is now quite well; however, Doctor Griffen
ordered sea air and change. Last time I saw her she
was prettier than ever, and looked like a <i>little angel</i>.&#8221;</p></div>

<p>Within five minutes Cara&#8217;s mother was whirling over
the pages of an A B C. She too would go to Folkestone
and see her baby at all hazards. A new nurse&mdash;what
a chance! She wired for rooms at one of the hotels,
packed up her boxes, paid her bill, and the following
day effected an early departure, arriving at Folkestone
the same evening. Here at least, she would be breathing
the same air as her darling.</p>

<p>An early hour the next morning found Mrs. Glyn on
the Leas, and as the month happened to be July these
were crowded. For two whole days, among nurses
and perambulators, she sought in vain for Cara. At
last, in a block near the band shelter, she descried
her treasure&mdash;attended by a buxom nurse, with a
gaudy magazine tucked under her arm; Letty hovered
around, or paced to and fro, till at last nurse and pram
moved slowly away, and she, following at a discreet
distance, discovered that they lodged in rooms not far
from her own hotel. Her next move was to endeavour
to make the nurse&#8217;s acquaintance, and this she accomplished
by sitting beside her on a bench overlooking
the sea, and offering timid remarks about the
weather, and admiration of the sleeping child.</p>

<p>The nurse (with visions of Sharsley to support her)
was inclined to be haughty and stand-off, but when
she had scrutinised the young lady, and her well-cut<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_243"></a>[243]</span>
costume, her pretty hat, and good new gloves, she
thawed so far as to admit that the &#8216;weather was a
treat,&#8217; and to accept the loan of an illustrated paper.</p>

<p>Letty, as she gazed at her sleeping child, was so
overcome with emotion, that she was impelled to get
up suddenly, and walk away; but presently returned
as the moth to the candle, and with a steady voice
informed the nurse, that &#8220;she was fond of children,
and that the little girl reminded her of someone.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;There is one o&#8217;clock striking,&#8221; said nurse, &#8220;and
that reminds <i>me</i> that it&#8217;s time for our dinner! Here&#8217;s
your paper, miss, and thank you.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Oh, please keep it, I don&#8217;t want it back! I have
any quantity of magazines, and books.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I do love reading, and specially magazines; but
I can&#8217;t well leave this child to go and buy things&mdash;you
see, I&#8217;m single-handed.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I will lend you magazines with pleasure,&#8221; volunteered
this kind stranger. &#8220;Shall you be on the
front to-morrow?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Yes, miss, at eleven, and if you can spare me
something lively&mdash;I love murders&mdash;I&#8217;ll be obliged to
you. I am a bit lonely now; a nurse, my friend, went
yesterday. The family&#8217;s gone over to Boulogne, and I
don&#8217;t have any talk with them boarding-house servants&mdash;they&#8217;re
no class; I won&#8217;t deny that I&#8217;m sociable,
but I&#8217;m suspicious of strangers, and as to who I know.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Of course,&#8221; assented Letty, &#8220;so am I&mdash;especially
as I am here by myself.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Oh, indeed!&#8221; with a quick inquisitive glance,<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_244"></a>[244]</span>
and then this pretty nameless young lady proceeded
to inform her, that she was waiting to be joined by a
relative, with whom she was going on the Continent;
for, as she sat beside this unsuspicious woman, Letty
had made up her mind to run away with the child!
and was already maturing her plans.</p>

<p>Presently Cara awoke. She was a beautiful little
girl of four, and as she opened her eyes, and stared up
at the face bending over her, to that lady&#8217;s horror,
and yet also to her joy, she ejaculated &#8220;Ma-ma!&#8221;</p>

<p>Her mother felt inclined to burst into tears, but
struggled to subdue her feelings, which found relief
in a wild, hysterical laugh.</p>

<p>&#8220;Aye, she takes you for her mamma,&#8221; explained
the nurse. &#8220;Every nice-looking, fair young lady, is
&#8216;<i>mamma</i>.&#8217; The poor little thing has no mother,&#8221; she
added in a low aside. &#8220;Could you believe that any
woman with a heart in her body, could desert <i>that</i>?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8216;That&#8217; was still drowsy, and, lulled by the soft
air and the distant band, had once more closed her
forget-me-not blue eyes, and fallen asleep.</p>

<p>Letty realised that her self-control was slipping from
her altogether, and with a hurried excuse of &#8216;letters,&#8217;
rose, and returned to her hotel. Each morning and
afternoon, she sought out the ruddy-faced, brown-eyed
nurse, with the smart white perambulator, and
her efforts to ingratiate herself with an uneducated,
chattering, kind-hearted woman, were almost those of
a timid lover, seeking to propitiate his mistress. She
was compelled to listen with averted face, whilst<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_245"></a>[245]</span>
Smithson volubly related to her her own history&mdash;as
reported and edited in the servants&#8217; hall.</p>

<p>&#8220;The child is like her mother, they do say; anyway,
in face. I never saw her&mdash;I&#8217;m a new-comer. <i>He</i>
is very ordinary: an ugly blue-and-red sort of colour,
and twenty years older than his wife. She was just a
slip of a schoolgirl, and by all accounts it was not so
much her fault&mdash;left alone for months in that great
lonely barrack of a place. They say the day after she
ran off, she repented and came back, and he just
threw her out! No one knows the rights of the story,&mdash;or
where she is now.&#8221;</p>

<p>Naturally these confidences were agonising to the
shrinking listener, who stared out on the shining sea,
and faint French coast-line, with a rigid profile; or
bent down her head, to finger the flounces of Cara&#8217;s
doll.</p>

<p>It was an indescribable relief when Nurse Smithson
selected another topic, and disclosed to her companion
in glowing terms, the glories of Sharsley, and the wealth
of its master. She gave luxuriant descriptions of the
park, the size of the grounds, the fame of the pictures,&mdash;but
kept back the fact, that the house was almost
closed, and that the shooting had been let. Then she
interrupted her tale to exclaim:</p>

<p>&#8220;Well, I never <i>did</i> see a young lady so fond of
children as you are,&mdash;miss, and the child has taken to
you too! Some day, you will be having one of your
own, I hope, and you will make a fine fuss with her, or
<i>I&#8217;m</i> mistaken.&#8221;</p>



<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_246"></a>[246]</span>Letty looked at her through blinding tears, then,
startled by her companion&#8217;s gaze of speechless amazement,
she hastily explained that &#8220;the glare of the sun
on the sea was so dazzling, that it always made her
eyes water!&#8221;</p>

<h2 class="nobreak">CHAPTER XXIV</h2>
</div>


<p class="drop-cap">FOR more than a fortnight, every morning and
every afternoon, Cara&#8217;s mother and nurse foregathered
by appointment: sometimes at the band on
the Leas, sometimes along the shady Lower Road;
and here Letty would wheel the perambulator. Her
admiration for the child was mutual, and she was
terrified, lest the nurse should wonder why the little
thing was always so ready to come to her, and why
she invariably called her &#8216;Mamma.&#8217;</p>

<p>&#8220;I am sure, you must be like her mother,&#8221; said
Smithson, &#8220;and that is why little Cara takes to you.
Aye, and they do say, that she was wrapped up in her.
Mr. Blagdon, he don&#8217;t care a brass farthing about the
child, and was main angry, that miss Cara wasn&#8217;t a
boy. He never comes to Sharsley, and the place was
that dreary, the old nurse give notice&mdash;<i>she</i> was a
vinegar-faced one, if you like, and they do say was a
spy on the lady. It was Lady Rashleigh&mdash;Mr. Blagdon&#8217;s
sister&mdash;that engaged me. She&#8217;s a funny one, with a
big face and a loud voice; it was her notion sending
the child down here, and later on, maybe, she&#8217;s coming
herself. She don&#8217;t care for Miss Cara&mdash;says we have
her spoiled. What do you say to that, missy? Sometimes,
you are a very naughty little girl, you know&#8221;<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_248"></a>[248]</span>
(missy, drowsy and indifferent, closed her big blue
eyes). Then the nurse lowering her voice, proceeded:
&#8220;Sometimes she looks like a little angel, doesn&#8217;t she?
But other times, I tell you, you&#8217;d think it was a little
devil you had to deal with! Of course, there being
no lady, it&#8217;s a responsible situation, and I&#8217;ve no nursemaid,
as you see; it&#8217;s a good place, and the wages is
first-class. <i>Sixty</i>&mdash;only for that, I never would stand
the loneliness&mdash;and the child.&#8221;</p>

<p>Horrified and indignant, Letty took the part of
her offspring, and replied:</p>

<p>&#8220;I have no doubt it <i>is</i> lonely living in the corner
of a great big house, with only Cara for your constant
companion: but then the child is such a darling!&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Eh, miss, you&#8217;ve heard the saying, &#8216;All is not
gold that glitters&#8217;? This one, will give somebody a
rare time yet; the best of her is all on the outside;
inside, she is just a greedy, selfish, treacherous, little
monkey!&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Oh, nurse, how can you say such dreadful things
of a poor innocent baby? I expect, that in your heart
you really don&#8217;t <i>care</i> about children. Now do you?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Well, of course, miss, it&#8217;s only to you, a stranger,
I would say what I do; it&#8217;s not likely, I&#8217;d tell this to
one of her relations, and her auntie is down enough on
her as it is. <i>She</i> sees through her arts, when we stay with
her in Town, and has given her some rare good smackings,
I can tell you! To you, as I say, being a stranger,
she is the most beautiful child in Folkestone&mdash;there
is not another on the Leas to touch her; all the nurses<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_249"></a>[249]</span>
envies me, and people crowds round her, as if she was
a show: and she smiles and carries on like anything&mdash;especially
to the gentlemen. How she&#8217;s learnt such
an awful amount of deceit, in such a short time, puzzles
<i>me</i>; she&#8217;s as sly as sly, and you&#8217;d never think there
was so strong a will in that little bit of a body, and
what she&#8217;ll be like, when she grows up, I&#8217;d be frightened
to say! She&#8217;ll grow up soon, I expect; but there&#8217;s
one thing I&#8217;m sure of, and that is, that, wherever she
is, she&#8217;ll give trouble!&#8221;</p>

<p>These alarming prophecies on the part of nurse held
no terrors for Letty, but only made her all the more
determined to snatch her darling from a woman who
did not appreciate her&mdash;who was not worthy to wheel
her perambulator. Smithson was a tremendous talker,
and, strange to say, exhibited no curiosity, with respect
to her companion. Contented with the fact that she was
a young lady who was rather delicate and was waiting
at the &#8216;Grand&#8217; for the arrival of a relative. Sometimes,
she vaguely wondered why she seemed to know no one,
and seemed so silent and downcast. However, this
sociable stranger was an acceptable acquaintance, who
often relieved her of her duties with Miss Cara; playing
with the child on the beach for hours, wheeling her in
the perambulator, making her daisy-chains, whilst
Mrs. Smithson skipped through library novels, talked
incessantly, and, occasionally leaving the lady in
charge, took the opportunity to do a little shopping.</p>

<p>Mrs. Smithson had confided to Letty, that she had
a cousin up at Shorncliffe: a sergeant-major with his<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_250"></a>[250]</span>
wife, and having no nursemaid had its drawbacks&mdash;for
she could never leave the child, and have an
afternoon off.</p>

<p>&#8220;Now there&#8217;s a play on at the theatre I&#8217;d give my
two eyes to see, and go to the <i>matin&eacute;e</i> next Saturday
with Carson and his wife; but I ask you, how can I?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;You can manage it perfectly well,&#8221; rejoined Letty
promptly. &#8220;I have nothing to do, and I shall be
delighted to take charge of Cara.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Oh, miss, you are really too kind! But I couldn&#8217;t
allow you to do such a thing.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I assure you I should really like it,&#8221; responded
the arch-deceiver. &#8220;I am fond of Cara, and I think
she is fond of me; so if you care to make your arrangements,
there is nothing whatever to prevent you going
to the <i>matin&eacute;e</i>.&#8221;</p>

<p>After some half-hearted expostulations, and protestations,
the whole thing was settled. Nurse Smithson
was to have Saturday afternoon all to herself,
from two till seven&mdash;so as to have ample time to go up
to the camp to tea with her cousin&mdash;and as Letty walked
back to lunch, she felt as if she was treading on air!</p>

<p>Saturday, and this was Tuesday! She had written
to Mrs. Hesketh, who vehemently opposed her scheme;
but seeing that Letty was fully determined to kidnap
Cara, reluctantly agreed to assist her.</p>

<p>On Wednesday afternoon, she came down to Folkestone,
in the hope of talking over her friend,&mdash;but this
expectation was fruitless. The boot was on the other
foot; it was Letty who talked <i>her</i> over! She seemed<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_251"></a>[251]</span>
changed: to have acquired a consciousness of power,
an air of graceful assurance, and the faculty of making
up her mind!</p>

<p>At dinner, there was a truce between their wrestling
personalities, but the new-comer resolved to have it
out with her young friend, as subsequently they
walked to the band on the lower Leas.</p>

<p>&#8220;Remember, Letty, you lose five hundred a year,&#8221;
she began, <i>&agrave; propos de rien</i>, as they approached the
rendezvous of hundreds of crowded chairs, the brilliantly
lit bandstand, and caught the flashes from
Cape Grisnez&mdash;illuminating a glassy Channel&mdash;starred
with the fishing fleet.</p>

<p>&#8220;That is true,&#8221; assented her companion; &#8220;but
then, I gain Cara, and, to <i>me</i>, she is worth ten times
that sum.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Then, my dear, perhaps you will also tell me how
you propose to live?&#8221; was the dry enquiry.</p>

<p>&#8220;I have saved two hundred pounds. Here are
seats&mdash;what a crowd! I&#8217;ll pay the collector&mdash;it&#8217;s
only coppers.&#8221;</p>

<p>Mrs. Hesketh, not a whit propitiated, went on to
state that two hundred pounds in the hands of a girl
who knew nothing of money, would not go far.</p>

<p>&#8220;Though,&#8221; she added, &#8220;of course <i>I</i> will help you.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;No, no indeed,&#8221; protested Letty, putting down a
strange dog that had sprung into her lap. &#8220;By and by
I hope to earn my living, and I will ask you to draw,
and to forward the interest on my legacy, and also to
sell my pearls, my mother&#8217;s necklace. They are<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_252"></a>[252]</span>
valuable; an Indian Rajah gave them to my father
for something he had done&mdash;saved him from an
assassin, I believe.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Nonsense! No, I don&#8217;t mean about your father,&#8221;
said her companion impatiently. &#8220;I have a plan;
that is to say, if you are bent on carrying out this act
of lunacy?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I am&mdash;oh, dearest cousin Maudie, I <i>must</i>! You
are strong and all-sufficient for yourself. I am a weak,
invertebrate creature.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Invertebrate&mdash;good word!&#8221; interrupted her friend.</p>

<p>&#8220;And I must have something to live for&mdash;something
to <i>love</i>.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;You had Lancelot Lumley.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;That&#8217;s different! I would only bring <i>him</i> shame
and trouble; but Cara is mine. I will rescue her, form
her character as well as ever I can,&mdash;and make her
happy.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I wonder if she will make <i>you</i> happy?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Of course she will. And now, what is your plan?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;You can leave your pearls with me in pawn, and
I will pay you thirty pounds a year on them, till you
return home, and claim them.&#8221;</p>

<p>For a long time Letty combated this suggestion:
in fact, all through the valse &#8216;Mes R&ecirc;ves,&#8217; played so
seductively by the band.</p>

<p>But Mrs. Hesketh, a practical woman, was determined
that her foolish friend should not fare forth
into the cold world, quite penniless, with the exception
of her hoarded two hundred pounds.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_253"></a>[253]</span>&#8220;And another thing, I must say, Letty, and that is
about the nurse. Have you thought of the frightful
trouble she will get into; and her state of mind when
she returns and finds that you have stolen her charge?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Yes: I am leaving a present, and a letter to clear
her entirely. I fancy she will be surprised when she
discovers that, of all people, I am Cara&#8217;s <i>mother</i>!&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;She won&#8217;t make friends again in a hurry, with
pretty strange ladies! You are a child in the ways of
the world; you have never in all your life had to
depend upon yourself, you don&#8217;t know the value of
money,&mdash;or how far it goes. As to earning it, I&#8217;m
afraid you will not have much chance of that in Switzerland,
among an untiring, and industrious people.
Seventy pounds a year, will at least keep you from
starvation: for Switzerland is a cheap country to live
in&mdash;once you leave the radius of the big hotels&mdash;so
you will give me your address, and four times a year
I will send you seventeen pounds. And perhaps, if
my health permits, I will go out, and settle myself
down somewhere near you, for a little while.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;That will be good of you. Oh, if you only <i>would</i>!&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;If it were suspected, that I was here with you,
abetting and aiding your criminal act, and arranging
for your departure, I should get into a nice scrape,
but you know, my dear, I have always liked you, and
I&#8217;m sorry you have made such an awful hash of your
life.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;So am I,&#8221; agreed Letty, with profound sincerity.</p>

<p>&#8220;My own marriage was not a success; my husband<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_254"></a>[254]</span>
and I were never sympathetic, we were always like
two goats chained to a log; but we kept it to ourselves,
and I am not sure, after all, that I am a very easy
woman to live with. I am restless and discontented,
I expect too much of life.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I should think you were excessively easy to live
with, Cousin Maude; you and I got on together
splendidly when we were abroad.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Yes,&#8221; she agreed, &#8220;but then I am growing old,
and the fires of life have died down. I must tell you,
Letty, that I do not think, and never will think, that
this step you are taking is a <i>wise</i> one. Of course,
your motherly heart is empty without the child;
but you are expatriating yourself on her account, you
have relinquished almost every shilling in the world
on her behalf, you have given up your friends, and
you have given up Lancelot Lumley. I hope, as the
years advance, that you will find that Cara has been
worth this sacrifice, and that when old enough to be
a companion, she will return your devotion four-fold.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;But, Cousin Maude, I cannot see <i>why</i> you think
I am making a mistake?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I have longer sight than you: it is unnatural for
a girl of one-and-twenty to cut herself adrift from the
world, and devote her life absolutely to a baby of four.
As I said to Blagdon, I have no doubt these things
were done in years gone by,&mdash;when a wife&#8217;s whole
existence was concentrated on her kitchen, and her
nursery; but now we live in more advanced times;
every woman has her place in the world, her individual<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_255"></a>[255]</span>
life&mdash;and, so to speak, her hand to play, and
you are sitting down to take the part of Dummy!&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Oh, Cousin Maude,&#8221; she protested, &#8220;how can
you say so? I have this darling child, she will be all
in all to me; it will be my pleasure to devote myself
to her, to work for her, and to bring her up to be <i>good</i>.
Think if I had left her with Hugo, or Hugo&#8217;s sister,
to be educated under their influence. How soon her
mind would be corrupted; what examples she would
see before her! I daresay by the time she was sixteen
she would be as bold and boisterous and evil-minded
as the worst&mdash;at least, I shall save her from <i>that</i>.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I hope so, my dear, and I agree with you, that the
society of Hugo Blagdon, his sister, and his friends,
would be a deplorable education for any girl.&#8221;</p>

<p>After a pause she continued:</p>

<p>&#8220;You are getting back your looks, Letty, and your
youth, and are no longer a stricken, haggard creature
of thirty, but once more a girl in your springtime&mdash;you
are divorced, and free. Supposing you were to
come across somebody you really love, and were to
marry again?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Oh, never, never! Besides, I don&#8217;t think a woman
who has been divorced, should marry.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;That is a much-debated question. And what
if Lancelot Lumley were to return, and claim you?
He has gone through the furnace for your sake.
His poor old father has entirely lost his memory, and
fortunately has never heard of the great Blagdon
scandal. The last time I saw Frances, it seemed to me<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_256"></a>[256]</span>
that she was changed; there were lines in her face,
and she looked out of spirits, and down on her luck.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Poor Frances, I have indeed returned her evil for
good. I cannot tell you what a support she was to
me in those days when I was alone at Sharsley. I was
so silly and nervous in that big house; always afraid
to go to bed. My room was by itself in the west wing,
and the rats in the wall, gave me palpitation of the
heart, and I used to think of ghosts too&mdash;the blind
Scrope lady, who gropes and fumbles outside doors&mdash;but
Frances would come up with books and jokes, and
insist on my going for walks with her, and talking me
out of my fears. She and you, are my best, and only,
friends.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Your best friend should be yourself, Letty&mdash;I can
only offer you money and advice&mdash;you accept neither.
How I wish I could give you what you want most&mdash;a
will; a will to keep upon a certain steady path.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I am on the right path now,&#8221; she answered, &#8220;and,
to follow your simile, hand in hand with Cara, I intend
to stick to a road that leads to happiness.&#8221;</p>

<p>Mrs. Hesketh muttered something under her breath
about a hedonist; then as the band played &#8216;God
Save the King,&#8217; they rose side by side, and presently
were swallowed up in the streaming crowds returning
to their several hotels; Letty expatiating on the beauty
of the moonlit night, her companion dumb and distrait,
in the face of the inevitable.</p>

<p>When the critical Saturday arrived, Nurse Smithson,
dressed in her best, what she called &#8216;private&#8217; clothes,<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_257"></a>[257]</span>
and a superb hat, went off in high spirits to the theatre,
attended by her friends. Letty collected the child&#8217;s
belongings, packed them in a trunk, and took her
away in a cab to the Pavilion Hotel, where she met
Mrs. Hesketh, and her own luggage. By the four
o&#8217;clock afternoon boat, among hordes of holiday
passengers, was a remarkably pretty girl in blue serge,
with a small fractious child in her charge. The two
were sped by a distinguished lady friend, who waved
to them from the end of the pier, as long as a handkerchief
was visible.</p>
<hr class="chap x-ebookmaker-drop" />

<div class="chapter">
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_258"></a>[258]</span>

<h2 class="nobreak">CHAPTER XXV</h2>
</div>


<p class="drop-cap2">AS it happened, the kidnapper was not an experienced
nurse, or accustomed to the sole charge
of a fractious child, and little Cara proved unexpectedly
peevish and obstreperous. The trip across to Boulogne
was well enough, but once in the railway carriage,
nothing seemed to please or pacify her; fruit, pictures,
chocolates, were but temporary alleviations; her one
shrill continuous cry, repeated a &#8216;crescendo,&#8217; was,
&#8220;I want my Ninny&mdash;I want my Ninny! I want
my <i>Ninny</i>!&#8221; and the more her mother soothed and
coaxed, the louder and more passionate became her
screams. The miserable passengers in her compartment
had no peace or rest, and thankfully parted at
B&acirc;le Station, with what a sleepless individual apostrophised,
as, &#8216;that accursed brat.&#8217; It was also with a
sigh of profound relief that her worn-out and haggard
mother, with the treasure in her arms, climbed down
into the airy, spacious station of Lucerne. As soon as
she had claimed her luggage, she drove off in a little
open trap to a well-known and well-recommended
hotel in the old town. Here, the fugitive remained
sequestered for several days, gathering herself together
before she made the next plunge.</p>

<p>She engaged a Swiss girl to help with Cara&mdash;a young<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_259"></a>[259]</span>
lady that never could be left alone, and demanded incessant
attention, and amusement. As she was carried
through the streets, or walked on the Quai, her yellow
hair and large blue eyes, attracted notice; people would
exclaim and admire her, and so, early in her career,
Miss Caroline Blagdon learned that she was a beauty,
and ideas thus prematurely absorbed, remain firmly
fixed throughout the remainder of a lifetime.</p>

<p>It was mid-August, and lovely Lucerne was at its
brightest and busiest; the promenade under the trees
on the Quai was almost impassable, the steamers plying
on the lake were black with crowds, and every hotel
and pension was crammed to the roof.</p>

<p>As Letty moved among the throng, and listened to
the sounds of gay voices, to the well-known Milanese
Orchestra, and felt the whirl of life about her: she
seemed to be a new creature in a new world. Once she
ventured into a tea-shop, but before she had been
there five minutes, she recognised the prim faces and
clear high bred treble of the two Miss Jessops,&mdash;who,
plates in hand, were cautiously selecting cakes, and
instantly abandoned her tea and fled.</p>

<p>On another occasion, she narrowly escaped recognition
in an embroidery shop, where she was launching
into a piece of wild extravagance on behalf of Cara,
and felt convinced, that Lucerne in the high season was
no place for a young woman who had recently stolen
her child!</p>

<p>She therefore began to set about making enquiries
concerning pensions, and farm-house apartments. Her<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_260"></a>[260]</span>
little nursemaid Magda, was able to tell her of one
that might suit; a farm on the left side of the lake,
where her sister worked, and she knew that Frau
Hurter&#8217;s boarder, a professor who wrote books, had
recently left for Berlin, and the Frau was looking for
another to replace him.</p>

<p>&#8220;Frau Hurter was a well-to-do widow with one son:
she kept ten cows; there would at least be no harm
if Madame were to make enquiries.&#8221;</p>

<p>No time like the present, and Madame, taking
Magda as her guide, went down by the two o&#8217;clock
boat&mdash;but fearful of being recognised, she remained
below in the stifling cabin, instead of on deck enjoying
all the glories of a superb afternoon. When the trio
landed, Magda led the way, carrying the child by
turns with her mistress.</p>

<p>After walking a mile, and passing an imposing hotel,
they left the road for a rough cart-track, which wound
up the hill-side amid laden orchards and prosperous
chalets, till they arrived (in a somewhat breathless
condition) at a faded signboard on which was inscribed
&#8216;Les Plans, Pension.&#8217; The pension, was a substantial
residence of dark weather-beaten wood, it had a
heavy peaked roof, bright green shutters, and a verandah.
The approach by a flagged path, led through a
garden which was at present a blaze of flowers: a mass
of standard roses, lilies, hydrangeas, and clove pinks;
further from the flagged path were apple and pear
trees, standard gooseberry bushes, and plots of lettuce.</p>

<p>On the doorstep of the entrance lay stretched out a<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_261"></a>[261]</span>
brown and white half-grown St. Bernard, and above the
lintel was the date 1780. Thanks to the indulgence of
the dog&mdash;an acquaintance of Magda&#8217;s&mdash;the trio entered.
The interior of Les Plans appeared more ancient than
the outside, with its green shutters and modern windows;
there was a long, and heavily beamed passage,
off which opened several rooms.</p>

<p>From one of these, a stout, middle-aged woman,
wearing a particularly firm expression, and a large blue
apron, advanced to enquire the lady&#8217;s pleasure.</p>

<p>The lady&#8217;s fluent German now came into exercise,
and she informed Frau Hurter that she was in search
of a comfortable farm-house, where she could have
two airy, sunny rooms, and plenty of milk for the
child.</p>

<p>&#8220;Your own little girl?&#8221; enquired the proprietor,
with an air of surprise. <i>She</i> had not wedded till close
on forty.</p>

<p>&#8220;I think I have what may suit. The Herr Professor
occupied my rooms for four summers; now he has
been called to a post in Berlin, and they are free.&#8221;</p>

<p>Then she led the way up very steep stairs to a
landing corresponding to the hall below, ushered her
visitor into two exquisitely clean rooms, one overlooking
the lake, the other the slopes of the Rigi. The
boards were bare, except for two or three home-made
rugs; the beds were of the usual comfortable German
pattern; tables covered with white cloths, two or
three chairs and washstands, and that was all.</p>

<p>As Letty surveyed the apartments, and their square-faced<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_262"></a>[262]</span>
upright owner, she assured herself that with a
few little extras she could make her home here; there
was always the matchless lake, with its changing
colours and incessant traffic, the beautiful mountains,
and no doubt there were appropriate and exhilarating
walks. The whole place smelt of roses, the air was
delicious; where could she find a better, or more
secure retreat?</p>

<p>Frau Hurter now conducted her visitor down the
break-neck stairs, in order that the English lady might
view her surroundings, for this shrewd woman, thoroughly
understood their marketable effect.</p>

<p>Before their eyes lay the flower garden, the spreading
meadows, laden orchards, and the glittering lake. At
the rear of Les Plans, rose a vast top-heavy structure,
the cow-house&mdash;(that chief feature on a Swiss farm).
The brown, weather-stained walls were almost concealed
by venerable pear trees, whose yellow fruit hung
in tempting profusion. The upper part of the building,
was evidently occupied by human beings; from beneath
came the incessant grunting of discontented pigs. Just
at present, the great cow stalls stood empty, and high
on the grassy hill-side, the ten dun cows were grazing
under laden apple trees&mdash;for Les Plans was a combination
of fruit orchard and dairy farm&mdash;their sturdy
calves were learning life and independence, and a
yearling bull, impeded by a log, swaggered about, with
an air of grotesque importance. Each animal wore its
bell, and the musical clanging of these, the hint of clear
mountain air, and the verdure of the exquisite green<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_263"></a>[263]</span>
background, made an impression on Letty that she
never forgot.</p>

<p>And now came the question of terms! The would-be
boarder was helplessly ignorant of money matters;
with Frau Hurter it was otherwise: she had learnt
the art of barter as a child, had a solid balance in the
bank of Lucerne, and was a capable and close-fisted
widow, who had managed her own affairs for years.
Needless to say she made a capital bargain.</p>

<p>&#8220;Would Madame be likely to stay long?&#8221;
she enquired, expecting the reply to be a month
or six weeks. She was amazed when Madame
replied:</p>

<p>&#8220;If I am comfortable here, I shall remain possibly
for years.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;And Madame&#8217;s name?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;My name,&#8221; she replied, &#8220;is Mrs. Glyn.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Is Madame a widow?&#8221; and the inquisitor searched
her face with a stare of hard scrutiny.</p>

<p>To this question she replied:</p>

<p>&#8220;I am married&mdash;this little girl is my child. I will
pay you a week in advance, and I must ask you to
consider this information sufficient.&#8221;</p>

<p>Frau Hurter almost felt as if a dove had flown in her
face! This beautiful English girl, who looked so
young and simple, and was so easy about money, was
not altogether as mild as she had supposed.</p>

<p>&#8220;Oh, very well,&#8221; she answered; &#8220;Madame&#8217;s affairs
are her affairs.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;We will come to-morrow,&#8221; announced Letty, &#8220;if<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_264"></a>[264]</span>
you will send someone to meet the two o&#8217;clock boat,
and bring our luggage.&#8221;</p>

<p>Thus the bargain was concluded, and sealed.</p>

<p>Before departure Frau Hurter conducted her future
lodger around the luxuriant garden; she gave the
child a cup of fresh milk, her mother a bunch of
roses, and Letty walked down the rugged cart-track
feeling more happy and elated than she had done for
years. She would live in this lovely and secluded spot,
where none of the troubles of the world could possibly
overtake her.&mdash;Would they not?</p>

<p>Within two or three days of her installation at Les
Plans, Letty found herself comfortably settled and at
home. The family consisted of Frau Hurter, the hard-featured
widow; her son Fritz, a handsome dark-eyed
schoolboy; Magda&#8217;s sister Freda, a squat, rosy-cheeked
young woman who laboured incessantly in
house and dairy, whilst over the cows and pigs resided
Hans Jost, and his consort. These were relatives of
Frau Hurter, who looked after the cattle and the farm&mdash;a
large one&mdash;and took the milk daily to a Laiterie
or Molkerei, which supplied some of the Lucerne
hotels. The heavy crops of apples and pears received
attention, and cartloads of the latter were despatched
to the great manufactory, to be converted into honey!</p>

<p>Little Cara, with her pretty face and caressing
manners, soon became the idol of Les Plans: the petting
and admiration hitherto conferred on Karo, the big,
long-legged St. Bernard, were now transferred to
&#8216;Mitli,&#8217; as she was called,&mdash;a German-Swiss pet name<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_265"></a>[265]</span>
for a small child,&mdash;and Mitli soon became familiar with
her court and its many resources, from the great tree
of sweet yellow plums in the corner of the garden, to
the boat which lay chained by the lake shore.</p>

<p>Her mother, too, made agreeable discoveries. There
were lovely walks in the vicinity; her surroundings
were soothing and reposeful, and she seemed to stand
aside in a beautiful sheltered retreat, whilst all the
world hurried by. The world, as typified in the white
steamers, crowded with passengers, that passed continually
up and down the lake; and within half a mile
was situated a popular hotel, which in the season was
always overflowing with fashionable guests. These,
she occasionally encountered in walks, which she took
accompanied by the deposed favourite, and more than
one halted to look after the solitary beauty, and her
attendant dog.</p>

<p>For once in her life, Letty was enjoying freedom and
a certain amount of happiness; but here again, when
memory drifted into deeper currents, she was constantly
tormented by the remembrance of Lancelot&mdash;high-minded,
generous, forbearing Lancelot, whom she
loved, would always love, and yet had forsaken and
lost.</p>

<p>Her good resolutions with respect to money were
soon broken; she purchased some extra furniture for
her two rooms, a reliable lamp, a tea-set, baths, and
actually invested in a piano which cost, second-hand,
thirty pounds&mdash;but her love for music almost amounted
to a passion; the instrument was installed in Frau<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_266"></a>[266]</span>
Hurter&#8217;s quaint and low-pitched sitting-room, and here,
when Cara was asleep, her mother enjoyed an hour or
two of undiluted pleasure.</p>

<p>Frequent letters from Mrs. Hesketh were delivered
at the farm, and Letty heard of the sensation created
by her abduction, and how there had been flaring
paragraphs in the papers, in which her name had
figured; but soon interest had slackened&mdash;it was less
than a nine days&#8217; wonder.</p>

<p>&#8220;You will be left in peace with Cara,&#8221; wrote Letty&#8217;s
friend, &#8220;Hugo will not set the detective after you; if
your theft had been a son and heir, by this time you
would be languishing in gaol.&#8221;</p>

<p>The season waned by degrees; many of the steamers
were laid up, the great hotels closed, and winter
descended from the mountains. By and by came grey
short days, and Les Plans was swallowed up in snow.
Letty had her piano and sewing, her books and her
child: Frau Hurter and Freda were busy with knitting
and spinning, Fritz with his lessons and outdoor games&mdash;and
he sometimes condescended to play with Cara.
His father had been Italian, and from him, he had inherited
his dark eyes, and his gay temperament.</p>

<p>The climate proved trying to an unaccustomed
foreigner, and the food was not appetising. In October,
three of the dissatisfied pigs were slain, and made into
ham and sausages, as provisions for the winter. As a
menu of sausages, bread, coffee, and cheese palled after
a time, the boarder supplemented the fare from her own
purse, and secretly resolved to spend the next winter in<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_267"></a>[267]</span>
Lucerne itself, returning to Les Plans with the spring.
By the end of the second year Mrs. Glyn found herself
seriously embarrassed for money. Alas! the two hundred
pounds had dissolved like snowflakes in the sun;
she had been obliged to dismiss Magda, and was now
nurse&mdash;a somewhat onerous post; she had wasted far
too much on follies: such as embroideries and pretty
shoes and hats for Cara, but whatever happened, and
whoever was pinched, it should <i>never</i> be the child.</p>

<p>The pretty Englishwoman had made a few friends
in the commercial world, who were impressed by her
air, her beauty, her voice, and maternal devotion.
Thanks to these kind friends in the Weggisgasse, she
found music pupils, and had learnt to execute embroidery
and lace, for which the town is famous, and
was fortunate enough to find regular customers in one
of the big shops; so that by working industriously,
she became self-supporting, and was moderately
content.</p>

<p>By the time Cara was a tall girl of eight, her mother
felt that her home for life was on the Lake of Lucerne,
and had accommodated herself to this conviction.
On holidays, she and Cara went boating with Fritz, or
made excursions up the mountains, whither Cara
pleased&mdash;everything was done with the view of pleasing
the child, who, well cared for, well dressed, and well
amused, was an amazingly pretty, headstrong, and unmanageable
girl.&mdash;Only as far as her mother was concerned&mdash;she
was still a little in awe of Frau Hurter, and
of Jost&#8217;s grim wife.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_268"></a>[268]</span>Cara had suffered herself to be taught her letters,
and even mastered &#8216;Reading Without Tears&#8217;; but
there she struck. History stories, and pretty maps were
flouted, and flung on the floor, and to her teacher&#8217;s
soft pleading&mdash;and even bribes&mdash;she interposed a will
as hard and solid as a wall of rock. Cara persistently
begged and teased to go to school in Mitzau; as usual
she gained her point, and accompanied by her mother
or Freda, went daily to an excellent seminary within
a mile of Les Plans, where she associated with the
children of the neighbouring farms. Among these, she
soon became a prominent leader, and absorbed many
facts and fancies, in addition to German Grammar, and
the history of the Swiss Republic.</p>

<div class="chapter">
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_269"></a>[269]</span>

<h2 class="nobreak">CHAPTER XXVI</h2>
</div>


<p class="drop-cap">FIVE times had the hill orchards blazed into
blossom, the Alpine wild flowers spread their
radiance over the slopes, and the white stillness of
winter descended on the scene, and yet the English
lady remained faithful to Les Plans. She had become
a part of the household, but Cara, who adventured her
young tendrils further than the farm, had many resources
and associates in the neighbourhood&mdash;though
her pretty mother contented herself with the company
of Frau Hurter, her books, and her needle. Owing to
an acute financial crisis, the piano had been sold. Letty
had a horror of debt, and when she made reckless purchases,
paid for her generosity by hours and weeks
of close and incessant labour, the result being a wan
face and agonising headaches. Then Frau Hurter,
with downright speech, would drive her forth for walks,
and clamour fiercely for half holidays.</p>

<p>&#8220;<i>Mein Frau</i>, you will have an illness, and a bad
one,&#8221; she would say; &#8220;and the doctors, they eat up
money. Ach ye! you sit all day stitch, stitch. You
must have our good fresh air and exercise, or you may
die&mdash;and then where would Mitli be, and I?&#8221;</p>

<p>So Letty, with Karo as her companion, took the
holidays and long walks and roamed over the mountains<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_270"></a>[270]</span>
along goat-paths, and by quaint old farms, and
weather-worn brown chalets. Her thoughts were not
<i>always</i> happy; sometimes she felt a touch of soul-ache;
for the warm blood of youth still throbbed in
her veins. It was true, that she had Cara, and Cara&#8217;s
love was hers; but then she was but nine years
old, and her natural disposition was unresponsive.
How she longed for a companion of her own country,
and her own age&mdash;someone whose ideas soared beyond
school-fellows and sweets&mdash;and it struck her painfully
at times, that Cara avoided her! Often, when she descended
to fetch her darling home, the child would
slip from her side, and attach herself to a class-mate,
and whisper eager confidences,&mdash;leaving her deserted
parent to walk alone; or when of an evening she was
ready to help with lessons, dress dolls, and play games,
Cara would suddenly jump up, and exclaim:</p>

<p>&#8220;Oh, this is stupid! stupid! I am going to look
for Fritz.&#8221;</p>

<p>But if subsequently a warm arm stole round Letty&#8217;s
neck, and a soft cheek were laid on hers, certain dark
misgivings were scattered to the winds, and the spirit
of patient confidence resumed its sovereignty. Occasionally
she went to Lucerne&mdash;commercial excursions,
connected with the sale of her work&mdash;and would treat
herself to a concert at the Casino, an organ recital at
the Hof Kirche, or visit friends in the Wienplatz and
the Weggisgasse. Her beauty, though unadorned, was
far too striking to be overlooked. This lovely and
lonely young lady, was stared at, followed, accosted.<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_271"></a>[271]</span>
Strangers&mdash;dealt with by Frau Hurter&mdash;and letters,
came to Les Plans&mdash;offers of marriage were not unknown!
A wealthy merchant from Milan; a dark
handsome Spaniard, presented himself as an anxious
suitor for the hand of the exquisite young widow&mdash;a
lady to whom he had never spoken, but whose dazzling
beauty and air of breeding, had captured his heart. A
clever engineer from Berne, also wrote impassioned and
insistent love-letters.</p>

<p>&#8220;Tell them, Frau Hurter, that I have a husband in
England,&#8221; said Letty with tremulous energy.</p>

<p>&#8220;A husband! and I thought Madame a widow.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;No; but we shall never meet again. I was very,
very unhappy, and I ran away with Cara.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Jesus Maria! and now I see why Madame has no
correspondence&mdash;no English visitors.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Yes, Frau Hurter, and if more Suisse visitors and
Suisse letters persecute me, I shall go to another place,
and find accommodation in a convent, where Cara can
learn, and I can work, unmolested.&#8221;</p>

<p>Naturally such a move was the last thing Frau
Hurter desired. She loved money, and could not
endure to part with a lodger, who gave no trouble,
paid extravagantly, &#8216;as per agreement,&#8217; and to the day.</p>

<p>&#8220;Madame does not wish to be found nor disturbed?
<i>I</i> will see to that,&#8221; declared Frau Hurter, looking forbiddingly,
grim, &#8220;and let people know that she is not
as they suppose, a widow. Yet Madame is too young
to lead the life of a nun&mdash;all work, no companions,
no pleasure.&#8221;</p>



<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_272"></a>[272]</span>&#8220;I only ask to be left alone. I am much happier here
than in England. My husband was not kind to me.&#8221;</p>

<p>Frau Hurter&#8217;s thoughts turned to her own mate;
the dark-eyed Italian mason, whom the cruel cold had
put to death, and alas! she realised, that she too had
been cold, to that warm-hearted child of the sun.
Well, she was making up for her neglect by a double
devotion to their boy.</p>

<p>And now at last behold an English visitor for Mrs.
Glyn! After many delays, broken promises, and
lengthy telegrams, Mrs. Hesketh came out to Switzerland
and engaged rooms at the H&ocirc;tel de Paradis&mdash;just
half a mile below Les Plans. She was welcomed at
Lucerne Station by Letty and her daughter; the
former, unexpectedly young and unchanged,&mdash;but a
little behind the fashion as to hat and costume. Cara,
a well-grown girl of ten, with bright pink cheeks, and
eyes the colour of a turquoise, wearing a smart embroidered
frock and sash, with an air of overwhelming
self-consciousness.</p>

<p>They lunched at the &#8216;Schweizerhof,&#8217; the guests of the
traveller, and to the unconcealed delight of Cara,&mdash;who
had never been inside the hotel till then. She stared
at everything and everyone, with sharp, observant
glances, and her godmother noted her appetite for
piquante sauces, and the richest sweets; also that her
blue eyes were hard, with a will and definite purpose,
and cast sly quick glances on herself,&mdash;as if curious
to know the effect she was producing.</p>

<p>Naturally with this little &#8216;pitcher&#8217; present, there<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_273"></a>[273]</span>
was no opportunity for any confidential talk between
the grown-ups. Mrs. Hesketh discoursed of home, her
journey, and other ordinary topics, and in the lounge
after <i>d&eacute;jeuner</i>, Cara stuck to the ladies like the proverbial
leech, and was sublimely indifferent to her
mother&#8217;s timid hint, that &#8216;she might care to look at
the new illustrated papers.&#8217; No, indeed, Cara preferred
to listen to this interesting new arrival; her
talk was a novelty, she liked to stare at her expensive
travelling-dress, her splendid rings, and
little jewelled watch. She had nice luggage too,
and a maid, and must be rich. Mrs. Hesketh was
her godmother, and it was the well-known duty, and
the <i>raison d&#8217;&ecirc;tre</i> of a godmother, to give expensive
presents.</p>

<p>After the trip down the lake, Mrs. Hesketh received
Letty in her charming sitting-room at the &#8216;Paradis,&#8217;
and said, as she closed the door:</p>

<p>&#8220;<i>Now</i> we can talk a little, my dear. But where is
Cara?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;She has gone out on the water with Fritz.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Do you mean that handsome lad who met us at
the boat?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Yes. They are old playmates. Please tell me,
what you think of Cara,&#8221; she asked eagerly.</p>

<p>&#8220;Her appearance, I suppose you mean? Cara does
you credit, a fine girl, who will develop into a fine
woman. She has your colouring, with her aunt&#8217;s
physique.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Oh, no, no&mdash;how can you say so!&#8221;</p>



<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_274"></a>[274]</span>&#8220;You have done your utmost; the child is well
nourished, well dressed, well drilled, and has been given
a good conceit of herself&mdash;anyone can see that <i>she</i> has
walked on the sunny side of the road!&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I have done my best, Cousin Maude.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;That is evident; and now, my dear, I have a
question to ask you.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Yes?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Was it worth it? Come, Letty, give me a straight
answer.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;What do you mean?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I mean running off with the child, forfeiting your
income, your country, your friends&mdash;yes&mdash;and your
lover&mdash;all to come out here, have Cara to yourself, and
work hard for her support.&#8221;</p>

<p>She paused for a moment. Then, as Letty was preparing
to answer, resumed:</p>

<p>&#8220;Is she your real treasure? Does she adore her
mother? In short, Letty, is this girl your <i>compensation</i>?&#8221;</p>

<p>Here was a direct, startling, and unexpected question.
For a moment Letty hesitated; as in a flash, memory
brought to her, Cara&#8217;s tempers, her tyranny of Les
Plans, her iron will, her secrecy&mdash;but oh, what cruel,
cruel, disloyal thoughts! How could a <i>mother</i> harbour
them? Looking up straight into her confessor&#8217;s eyes,
she replied:</p>

<p>&#8220;I have no regrets, and I would do it again!&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Ah&mdash;would you!&#8221; the tone was dubious. &#8220;Lately
it has seemed to me, my dear, that your letters were<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_275"></a>[275]</span>
terribly depressed&mdash;that is to say, reading between the
lines.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Well, of course, sometimes one is lonely, and longs
to do things, and to see people.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;If you had only played your cards properly,
Blagdon would have made the girl over to you&mdash;and
with a respectable allowance. He did not know
what to do with her; Lady Rashleigh couldn&#8217;t endure
her, and his mother is too infirm to undertake a lively
grandchild.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I don&#8217;t agree with you. If Hugo thought I wanted
Cara, he would have kept her, for that very reason.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I hear he has gone in more than ever for racing,
with Sir Tom as his guide, and has burnt his
fingers rather badly. It is said he wishes to marry
again, an heiress or a rich widow; meanwhile Connie
Rashleigh lives with him most of the year.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;And Mrs. Corbett?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;No&mdash;as soon as she heard that her husband had
made a huge fortune in the Argentine, she patched up
a truce, and went out to spend it.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;And the Dentons&mdash;how are they?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Much as usual&mdash;getting a little older and greyer,
By the way, do you ever hear from Lancelot?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;No,&#8221; colouring; &#8220;of course not&mdash;never.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;He is rising rapidly in his profession&mdash;&mdash;&#8221; She
paused. No need to tell Letty that he was at present
on leave in England. &#8220;Frances, as you know, is still
Miss Lumley. How is it, that all the minxes get snapped
up, and the treasures are left?&#8221;</p>



<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_276"></a>[276]</span>To this question, her companion made no reply.
Had not she herself, been, so to speak, &#8216;snapped up&#8217;?</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>Every day Mrs. Hesketh and her friend spent many
hours in each other&#8217;s company; either Letty descended
to the hotel, or Mrs. Hesketh climbed to Les Plans.
Many an afternoon she sat out in the garden or the
orchard, enjoying the view, and Frau Hurter&#8217;s incomparable
coffee, and she rubbed up her rusty German
in order to converse with this stern-looking, industrious
widow, who owned and worked the prosperous farm;
rising at daybreak to see to the poultry and milking,
her knitting rarely out of her capable hands, and
knitting furiously all the while she talked.&mdash;It was her
boast, that never in her life had she bought a stocking
or a sock! The new-comer could see, that in her downright
phlegmatic fashion, Freda Hurter was fond of her
English inmate, and very proud of her appearance&mdash;such
a contrast to her own deeply lined, hard-featured
visage! But how it changed, and brightened when
she spoke of Fritz. Yes, he was a clever fellow,
and was to be educated in Zurich; afterwards he
would come home to the farm, and take some day a
wife, and she&mdash;her work done&mdash;would sit in the sun,
and read her Bible.</p>

<p>Letty conducted her visitor to all her favourite
haunts, and walks, exhibited the <i>Ku Stal</i>, and
&#8216;Mogli,&#8217; her tame pet cow, who knew her so well&mdash;a
famous dun giving, when in full milk, twenty-four<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_277"></a>[277]</span>
litres a day. Mrs. Hesketh took stock of Les Plans
and its surroundings, her quick eyes made notes of the
Josts; brown and rugged as two old leafless trees,
determination, avarice, and honesty, engraved upon
their faces. Nor did she fail to observe handsome
Fritz, with his dark, expressive eyes, and
beaming Cara, his constant attendant; the girl
was a born hoyden&mdash;could row, skate, climb, and
yodel. No doubt healthy outdoor life was an
excellent outlet for her overpowering spirits, and
activity. She was evidently a favourite among the
farm-folk, with the exception of Jost&#8217;s wife, and the
dog Karo,&mdash;who slunk away when Cara approached,
and growled if she teased him.</p>

<p>It seemed to the onlooker, that the girl was something
of a tyrant, who accepted all favours as her unquestionable
right. Her mother&#8217;s love, and devotion,
the indulgence of her companions&mdash;over whom she
governed as a despotic monarch. Whatever Mitli said
or wished was law: for <i>she</i> ruled Fritz, who ruled
his mother, who ruled Les Plans.</p>

<p>One afternoon her mother and godmother sat together
under a shady plane tree on the hill-side,
Karo extended at their feet, occasionally snapping at
flies, or, laying his head in Letty&#8217;s lap, adoring her
with his deep, soft eyes.</p>

<p>&#8220;So you say, that Cara wants to go to the Convent
at Lucerne after next term?&#8221; said Mrs. Hesketh.</p>

<p>&#8220;Yes, with two or three of her friends. I hear it
highly recommended. She would be a daily boarder.&#8221;</p>



<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_278"></a>[278]</span>&#8220;And after the Convent&mdash;when the girl considers
herself educated&mdash;what then?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I have not thought of that yet.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Then my dear, the sooner you begin to think of it
the better; you cannot keep Cara on a Swiss farm all her
days; she is not that type. Cara is for towns, and cities.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Oh, well, after all she is only ten,&#8221; protested her
mother. &#8220;No need to worry about <i>her</i> future yet.
Isn&#8217;t it a perfect afternoon, Cousin Maude?&#8221;</p>

<p>It was, indeed; there was magic in the air. Across
the lake, the wooded slopes dipped into emerald and
silver; high up beyond woods and crags, outlined
against a blue, blue sky, was the snowy range; every
ridge and peak bathed in delicate rose-colour&mdash;truly
these were the mountains of Fairyland: close by the
friends, an urgent stream sang on its way to the lake,
and all around was green luxuriance, tinkling cow-bells,
and the faint perfume of fruit, and flowers.</p>

<p>Mrs. Hesketh withdrew her gaze from the prospect,
to fix them on her companion. Here was a face and
figure in complete harmony with the exquisite scene;
she studied Letty&#8217;s slender grace, her clouds of soft
hair (darker than formerly), the perfect outlines of
cheek and feature, and the long lashes sweeping the
flawless skin. Truly a haunting picture! If the view
was one to lure the hurried traveller,&mdash;here was a
beauty to lure mankind.</p>

<p>&#8220;Yes, Cara is only ten,&#8221; began Mrs. Hesketh
suddenly. &#8220;As for you, Letty, who are young&mdash;without
youth.&#8221;</p>



<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_279"></a>[279]</span>&#8220;What about me?&#8221; she asked with a smile. &#8220;I
am getting on for <i>three</i> times ten!&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;You are, and you are wasting your life here&mdash;youth&mdash;beautiful
youth&mdash;is passing, and why, oh,
why don&#8217;t you value it? This I know is the cry of
age and regret: I am an old woman, I am satisfied
to sit still, and be a spectator; but you, who are
twenty-eight, and have golden years awaiting you,
oh, how <i>can</i> you endure this existence of passionless
monotony?&#8221;</p>

<p>Amazed by such an unusual outburst, Letty replied:</p>

<p>&#8220;I have Cara, plenty of occupation, and no cares.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;No cares!&#8221; echoed her companion, and she
gave a shrill laugh. &#8220;Even at Les Plans, Care may
put his head in at the door. Voyaging in smooth
waters&mdash;has its risks. Another thing, it is not good
for Cara to lead this wild, independent life; she ought
to be at home associating with girls of her own class.
Listen to me, Letty,&#8221; laying as she spoke an impressive
hand on her knee, &#8220;I am a lonely woman; I am fond
of you. Suppose you and your girl come over to
England, and make your home with <i>me</i>?&#8221;</p>

<p>But in spite of a loving, eloquent, and insistent invitation
Letty could not be induced to abandon Les Plans.</p>

<p>&#8220;I love you, and I am grateful, dearest Cousin
Maude, my friend from the first; but here I am at
home, and here I feel <i>safe</i>.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;What is there to fear now?&#8221; demanded Mrs.
Hesketh. &#8220;Blagdon will never trouble you; but
should he do so, I will deal with him&mdash;leave him to me.&#8221;</p>



<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_280"></a>[280]</span>&#8220;He would take Cara from me, and just at the
critical age, when her character is forming.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Her character <i>is</i> formed,&#8221; rejoined the other, with
conviction. As she spoke, her eyes were fixed upon a
neighbouring apple tree, with Fritz among its shaking
branches; immediately below, stood an expectant
figure with an imperious voice, and outstretched
skirts.</p>

<p>&#8220;I have a terrible presentiment,&#8221; continued Letty,
&#8220;so keen, that it actually hurts me.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Bah,&#8221; scoffed Mrs. Hesketh, &#8220;I don&#8217;t believe in
such things,&mdash;in absolutely nothing beyond the range
of sense. Why go to meet trouble half way? What
is your bug-a-boo?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;That Hugo will find us yet&mdash;and take Cara from
me.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;My dear, I can assure you, that if Cara is taken&mdash;against
her will&mdash;as I believe would be the case&mdash;she
will make her father rue the day, and bitterly repent
of his folly in sackcloth and ashes. For my part,&#8221;
she went on courageously, &#8220;I wish to goodness, he
<i>would</i>&mdash;steal her!&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Oh, Cousin Maude!&#8221; cried Letty, turning to her
a glowing face, &#8220;what a cruel, cruel thing to wish!&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Possibly it was; but honestly I feel, as they say in
Norfolk, &#8216;as if I&#8217;d like to do someone an injury,&#8217;
when I think of the years that your locust has eaten.&#8221;</p>

<p>This announcement, transfixing and incredible,
had the effect of reducing Letty to absolute silence.
Sometimes Cousin Maude had odd moods and made<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_281"></a>[281]</span>
wild and extraordinary statements; on such occasions
it was prudent to be mute.</p>

<p>Presently they rose, and wandered back to the farm,
and were greeted by Cara, who came bounding to
meet them, screaming at the top of her voice:</p>

<p>&#8220;Tea is ready, and I&#8217;m so hungry&mdash;there&#8217;s hot
cakes and cherry jam!&#8221;</p>

<p>A few days later, Mrs. Hesketh ordered a sleeping-berth,
and prepared to return to Thornby, where
important law business awaited her.</p>

<p>&#8220;How I shall miss you,&#8221; said Letty, as they took
their last walk together by the lake-side, and watched
the lights begin to twinkle in far-away Lucerne.
&#8220;It will be worse for me, than if you had never come.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Nonsense, my dear,&#8221; rejoined her friend; &#8220;it
is only in story-books that people are missed. As for
you,&mdash;you have the remedy in your own hands.&#8221;</p>

<p>But Letty&#8217;s determination was unshaken, and, as
her companion angrily declared:</p>

<p>&#8220;You are always strong and obstinate, where you
ought to be yielding; and yielding, where you should
be firm.&#8221;</p>

<p>Mrs. Hesketh departed, and left behind her such an
aching void, that more than once Letty, the obstinate,
found her resolve sorely shaken, and felt half inclined
to take all risks, and follow her friend to England.</p>

<h2 class="nobreak">CHAPTER XXVII</h2>
</div>


<p class="drop-cap">ONE lovely September afternoon, when the <i>Schiller</i>
touched at the pier at Mitzau, among the
passengers who boarded her, were Cara, her mother, and
Fritz. The boat was crowded with trippers and
tourists, and when Letty had with difficulty arrived
on the first-class upper deck, there was not a seat
to be found. As she glanced about her vaguely, a tall,
bronzed Englishman in grey tweed, got up and offered
her his place. When she looked round to thank him
and discovered no stranger&#8217;s face, but that of Lancelot
Lumley, her amazement was such, that for a moment
she felt dizzy; for his part, it was fully half a minute
before Major Lumley realised, that this remarkably
pretty girl in a summer gown and shady hat, was his
lost love, Letty Blagdon!&mdash;Letty, who had befooled
him, made him the prey of her indecision, and the
laughing-stock of his acquaintance.</p>

<p>How often in camp and cantonment, had he sworn
to himself to put her out of his head and his
heart; he had even embarked on other love affairs;
many ladies had smiled on Major Lumley, who was
handsome, popular, and likely to have a distinguished
career. But somehow his flirtations had
never advanced; at the back of his mind, his heart,<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_283"></a>[283]</span>
his vision, rose the figure of Letty. Now here she
stood before him in real life, and as she looked
up with her earnest Irish eyes, he knew that her hold
upon him was stronger than ever. How young she
seemed! like the sister of the tall girl, who had joined
her.</p>

<p>&#8220;<i>Letty!</i>&#8221; he said at last; he had grown pale under
his tan. &#8220;And&mdash;and&#8221;&mdash;holding out his hand&mdash;&#8220;I
suppose&mdash;this must be Cara?&#8221;</p>

<p>Cara, agreeably conscious of her own appearance,
was delighted to be accosted by this distinguished-looking
Englishman. Her mother appeared to have
no friends, except hateful Mrs. Hesketh&mdash;here, however,
was another of a very different stamp!</p>

<p>At first it seemed to be he and Cara, who were so well
acquainted, and carrying on a brisk conversation.
Presently, she was summoned by Fritz to interview a
monkey, and her mother and Lumley were alone.</p>

<p>&#8220;And so all these years you have hidden yourself in
Switzerland,&#8221; he said, as together they moved to the
side. &#8220;Frances would never divulge your address.
What an amazing, miraculous, chance, this meeting.
I just missed the earlier boat by one minute. I am not
superstitious, but there is something uncannily significant
in our coming across one another in this way.&#8221;</p>

<p>The couple, leaning over the bulwarks, indifferent
to their surroundings, had much to say to one another
as the <i>Schiller</i> forged along through water of a deep
peacock blue, shaded in the distance to a silvered surface.
By degrees, as Letty&#8217;s tongue became loosened,<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_284"></a>[284]</span>
she gave her companion a rapid account of her
life during the past seven years, and it was evident
to her listener (though not to herself) that her existence
had been one of entire self-sacrifice for the child.
He on his part, talked of the death of his father, of
Frances, of his brother officers, his work, and his
prospects.</p>

<p>&#8220;I&#8217;ve just got a shove up,&#8221; he said, &#8220;and been
posted to a good job. I&#8217;m on my way back from
leave, and taking the Italian lakes <i>en route</i>, as I
have a week to spare. I saw Mrs. Hesketh at home;
she had lately come back from Switzerland. She
never told me that she had seen <i>you</i>.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;No, and when she was out here, she never told me
that you were at home on leave.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I suppose she thinks silence is best&mdash;and that all
is over.&#8221; Seeing Letty&#8217;s bare hand lying on the rail,
he took it up, and said:</p>

<p>&#8220;I say, you don&#8217;t mean that you are still wearing
that fellow&#8217;s ring!&#8221;</p>

<p>In another second, it was removed from her finger,
the next, it glittered through the sunshine, and fell
into the blue water, with a faint splash.</p>

<p>&#8220;Oh!&#8221; she stammered, &#8220;how dared you? how
could you?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;How could <i>you</i>, Letty?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Well, I shall have to replace it at once.&mdash;I wonder
if Cara will miss it?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;What harm if she does! Look here, Letty, I
believe good fortune deliberately arranged this meeting,<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_285"></a>[285]</span>
and now I intend to make hay whilst the sun
shines. Will you marry me, and come with me to
India?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Lancelot!&#8221; she exclaimed, raising a scared
face to his. &#8220;You take my breath away. Are you
crazy?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Never more absolutely sane, or sensible, in my
life. We have lived down scandal, I hope and believe,
and what is there now to stand between us? Blagdon
is by all accounts consoled&mdash;I say no more&mdash;and you
are free. Do you return to the farm by the next boat,
make all arrangements, pack, and order what you require
in the way of outfit in Lucerne. For my part, I
shall look up the Consul, and the chaplain, wire for
another passage, and as Mrs. Lumley, you will sail
from Genoa this day week.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;No, no!&#8221; she insisted, &#8220;don&#8217;t go on.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;But I haven&#8217;t half done yet! You will like India;
you were born out there, and have often heard the East
a-calling. You know you have always wished to see it,
and India will like you. After making a bad start
at seventeen, you begin life over again at twenty-nine,
and I declare to you, Letty, you don&#8217;t look a day older
than twenty-four&mdash;you and Cara might be sisters.
Now what do you say?&#8221; and his eyes held hers with
an intentness remarkable in human gaze.</p>

<p>After a pause she faltered:</p>

<p>&#8220;And what about Cara?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Cara!&#8221; he echoed. &#8220;Why, you will leave her at
home, to be sure. You have done your share for her<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_286"></a>[286]</span>
nobly, and it&#8217;s time she went to school&mdash;she is a big
girl for her age.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Oh, but I could not part with her. If I were to
desert her, and send her to England, her father would
claim her at once. Couldn&#8217;t we take her out with us?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I&#8217;m afraid,&#8221; and he hesitated, &#8220;that Burmah&mdash;where
I shall be for the next year&mdash;would be terribly
trying for a girl of her age&mdash;in fact, to make no bones
about it, if we took Cara out, she would be running a
serious risk.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Then that settles it,&#8221; said her mother, with
decision. &#8220;Lancelot, I am very, very sorry, unspeakably
sorry&mdash;but you must return alone.&#8221;</p>

<p>It was in vain, that Major Lumley, like Mrs. Hesketh,
argued and urged; his eloquence was wasted.</p>

<p>&#8220;I would go with you with joy and thankfulness
to the end of the earth&mdash;but my first duty is to Cara.&#8221;</p>

<p>Lumley glanced at the tall, well-grown girl, with
her rosy cheeks, and quick, bold eyes; and it seemed
to him, that she was already well advanced in the
wiles of a coquette as she laughed at, and teased the
handsome youth, her companion.</p>

<p>&#8220;After all, Letty, your girl is perfectly safe in
England,&#8221; he urged. &#8220;Frances will find her a good
school, and I shall pay for her education. I feel
positively certain, that Blagdon will never trouble his
head about her. He and his sister are mixed up with
racing sets, and have no thoughts for anything else&mdash;and
then, reflect&mdash;we are not old, you and I. We
have known one another for years. Time is passing;<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_287"></a>[287]</span>
here is the chance of our lives, and you want to throw
it away. If we part now, we may never meet
again.&#8221;</p>

<p>Letty made no audible reply. She shook her head
sadly and hopelessly, and tears ran down her face
and dripped on the side of the steamer.</p>

<p>Just at this unpropitious moment Cara rushed up,
and unceremoniously thrusting herself between her
mother, and her companion, said:</p>

<p>&#8220;Mummy, I want a franc to buy some fruit!
Why, Mummy,&#8221; she exclaimed, &#8220;you are crying!
How funny!&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Do you think crying funny?&#8221; demanded Lumley,
and his voice was sharp.</p>

<p>&#8220;Yes&mdash;for Mummy,&#8221; she answered, unabashed;
&#8220;she never cries except at nights&mdash;when she thinks
no one knows. I cry often.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;You speak as if you enjoyed it,&#8221; he continued,
giving Letty time to recover her composure. &#8220;What
makes you cry?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;If I want things and Mummy says no; but
when I cry, she always gives in.&#8221; A pause, and
staring steadily at him, she continued, &#8220;What a
long talk you and the Mum have had&mdash;all the way
from Gersau, to Tell&#8217;s Chapel&mdash;and we are close to
Fluellen.&#8221;</p>

<p>Yes, so they were, and at Fluellen he joined the
mail-train, which bore him south. It was the end of
his journey; it was also the close of his brief dream
of hope.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_288"></a>[288]</span>&#8220;Here,&#8221; he said to Cara, handing her a little bit
of gold, &#8220;run and buy fruit, and don&#8217;t bother your
mother.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Ah-ha!&#8221; she answered, with a knowing nod,
her eyes bright with incipient coquetry, &#8220;want to get
rid of me, don&#8217;t you? but thank you a million times
all the same,&#8221; and kissing her hand, she ran off to join
Fritz and exhibit her prize.</p>

<p>&#8220;You must give me your address,&#8221; said Major
Lumley, turning to Letty, &#8220;and we will write to one
another.&#8221; As he spoke, he produced a notebook.
&#8220;I hope you will never repent of your answer; but
I believe in my heart, that some day you will be sorry
for yourself&mdash;yes, and for me. One word more:
Cara will be a beauty&mdash;in a year or two&mdash;and rule
you, and be in that respect, her father&#8217;s daughter.
You are always a slave to someone; first it was your
aunt, then Blagdon, now the girl&mdash;and <i>I</i> would give
you freedom.&#8221;</p>

<p>For the moment Letty was unable to speak or
control her trembling lips. The boat was alongside;
already the passengers were crowding ashore and
streaming towards the station. As the luggage was
being carried away, she found her voice at last, and
faltered:</p>

<p>&#8220;No doubt, once you are gone I&#8217;ll wish I had
said yes, and if I said yes, I would be wishing I&#8217;d
said no. You must think me obstinate, heartless,
and weak; but I have never cared for anyone as
much as for you&mdash;and never will. I&#8217;ve thought of<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_289"></a>[289]</span>
you every day, during these long, lonely years&mdash;but
I must put duty first.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;That is to say, Cara,&#8221; he broke in angrily, &#8220;apparently
you have no personality, no identity of your
own. Well, Letty, let us hope that Cara will reward
you. Here we are! I see the fellow has got me an
empty carriage,&#8221; and he halted. &#8220;If ever you are in
trouble&mdash;bad trouble&mdash;cable for me, and I&#8217;ll come
back, and see you through. Now good-bye.&#8221; He
wrung her hand, and without another glance climbed
into the compartment. As the heavy St. Gothard
express dragged itself out of the station, he never
looked out of the window or waved a signal to the
stricken figure on the platform. Lancelot had gone,
he had departed in disappointment, and displeasure.</p>

<p>Meanwhile Cara (who had been occupied at a fruit
stall, and subsequently sought a restaurant, there
to indulge Fritz and herself with coffee and cakes)
appeared to have totally forgotten her parent. On
the return journey, Letty descended into the empty
fore cabin&mdash;the emotion of the recent scene was
still thrilling all her pulses&mdash;and there she wept
unobserved, and unrestrained, the whole way back
to their own particular landing-stage,&mdash;mercilessly
tortured by the clamouring questions, had she done
right? had she done wrong?</p>

<p>The problem was unsolved, when the steamer touched
at Mitzau; it remained unanswered, for years.</p>

<h2 class="nobreak">CHAPTER XXVIII</h2>
</div>


<p class="drop-cap">SEVERAL summers had passed since that dramatic
meeting on the <i>Schiller</i>, and these swiftly flying,
monotonous years, had left their mark upon Les Plans
and its belongings. One fine spring morning Mordi,
the queen of cows, had been driven from the orchard
by a strange man,&mdash;a butcher from Lucerne. In his
company, Mordi took her first and last trip upon the
familiar lake, and her comrades knew her no more.
Karo, the farm&#8217;s brown and white guardian, had
recently died, suddenly and mysteriously. He was
found at his post, the entrance door, stiff and stark.
Jan Jost was more bent and rheumatic than formerly;
his wife more wrinkled and shrewish; but naturally
the most remarkable change was to be seen in the two
young people, Fritz and Mitli. Fritz at twenty-three
was well educated, and well thought of,&mdash;especially by
farmers with daughters, on account of his prospects;
by the daughters, because of his celebrated prowess in
sports, his handsome face, and lithe activity.</p>

<p>Since his course at Zurich was finished, Fritz had
lived at home, helping somewhat fitfully to work Les
Plans. His mother seemed a little grimmer and more
taciturn,&mdash;indeed, her manner was occasionally forbidding,&mdash;always
working&mdash;or always knitting, with<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_291"></a>[291]</span>
unceasing fury, and always keeping her thoughts to
herself;&mdash;these, were chiefly occupied by her son, and
Mitli.</p>

<p>Mitli, in her seventeenth year, was tall and fully
developed; she looked older than her age, and beyond
a flawless complexion, ropes of yellow hair, and a pair
of gay blue eyes, was not endowed with the usual
attributes of &#8216;sweet seventeen.&#8217; She took after the
Blagdons in figure and character, and was of a determined,
masterful, and restless disposition. Her intellectual
faculties were dull; she evinced no taste for
literature or reading, beyond the daily paper, <i>Le Monde
Amusant</i>, and sundry and various French novels.
As for her mother&#8217;s pursuits, needlework, music,
and gardening, she hated them impartially; sewing
tried her eyes, gardening gave her a backache, music
was a bore. Tennis, dancing, skating were more to her
taste. She rowed on the lake, and climbed the hills
with Fritz, and accepted his love, his homage, and his
gifts, with radiant complacency. Such was Cara!</p>

<p>Of late, she had spent most of the year in Lucerne,
not merely in winter with her mother in the Weggisgasse,
but in summer too. There was such difficulty
about coming and going from Les Plans; the hours
of the steamers, did not suit; the child&#8217;s education
must not be neglected, and after considerable demur,
and pressure, it had been arranged for Cara to board
with the family of one of her friends, and attend the
convent as an <i>externe</i>, returning home for week-ends,
and all holidays. Her godmother had insisted on<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_292"></a>[292]</span>
paying for her education, and her mother reluctantly
submitted; for in spite of good prices for lace, the
work was tedious, and Cara&#8217;s expenses for dress and
amusement had become surprisingly heavy. She displayed
an extravagant fancy for expensive hats and
frocks and shoes,&mdash;and when she wanted money&mdash;an
overpowering seductiveness, that her mother was
totally unable to resist. Cara&#8217;s sweet kisses, caresses,
and endearing epithets, were as balm to a heart that
was starving for love, and she plied her needle bravely
in order that the child should look nice, and&mdash;as a
natural sequence&mdash;be happy.</p>

<p>The &#8216;child&#8217; ran accounts in her mother&#8217;s name at
Schweizer&#8217;s and other shops, and when the bills presented
themselves in the shape of so many shocks,
Cara would excuse herself by saying, in an airy way:</p>

<p>&#8220;Well, darling Mum, it&#8217;s all your own fault! Ever
since I was a baby you have made a fuss about dressing
me, and don&#8217;t I do you credit?&#8221;</p>

<p>She did; there was no denying the fact. In a
beautifully cut embroidered linen, and a simple French
hat, Cara might be remarked at Hurlingham or Ranelagh,
but she was a little out of keeping with her
background in a farm kitchen&mdash;where, being in a
hurry to catch the boat, she gobbled her hasty
<i>d&eacute;jeuner</i> of rice and stewed veal.</p>

<p>Cara&#8217;s independence and air of breezy emancipation,
had come by degrees, ever since she had gone to live
with her friend Berthe Baer on the slopes of the
Drei Linden. This change of abode and surroundings<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_293"></a>[293]</span>
had given her an air of freedom and self-sufficiency,
and she now ruled her mother with an absolute sway.
Grown up, her own mistress, and on the threshold of
life, she was resolved to make the best of her youth
and have a really good time; since hers was a hard,
shrewd, and absolutely pleasure-loving character. Cara
was fond in a way of her pretty girlish Mum,&mdash;who was
so often and so annoyingly mistaken for her sister&mdash;but
the Mum was so tame, unenterprising, and easily contented;
her books and work and walks, were all <i>she</i>
asked for; but Cara, notwithstanding her sharp sight,
was mistaken. Her mother was far from being contented.
As she rambled alone, or sat at her lace
cushion, her thoughts, though inarticulate, were many
and rebellious; they spoke a plain language, and put
many crucial questions to her heart, and brain. In her
life of thirty-five years, she humbly confessed to many
fatal errors. Her first mistake, was in marrying Hugo
Blagdon&mdash;that was an act of sheer cowardice. The
second, her muddled runaway; the third, in refusing
Lancelot Lumley&#8217;s appeal made six years
previously.</p>

<p>Cara, she now realised, was capable of standing alone,
and successfully fighting her own battles. Her determination
to live in Lucerne, had proved this most
decisively; and now she and her girl were no longer
so much to one another. Cara demanded a separate
bedroom. &#8220;Two in a room was so stuffy,&#8221; and there
were no nightly talks and confidences, and any hold
she ever had on her child, was imperceptibly slipping<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_294"></a>[294]</span>
away; the girl had her own friends, Luisa Maas, Hilda
Vorgen, and the Baers, with whom she boarded.</p>

<p>She and Berthe were inseparable, and Berthe, a
simple-minded, giggling, good-tempered girl of eighteen,
could do her darling no harm. One question repeatedly
thrust itself forward with irrepressible pertinacity:</p>

<p>&#8220;Had she brought Cara up wisely? Had she not
been <i>too</i> indulgent?&#8221;</p>

<p>In the most serious contentions between them, she
had frequently given way. Now Cara was full grown
and talked as a woman&mdash;a woman with weighty
authority. Where had she acquired her experience?&mdash;from
books? Since Mrs. Hesketh&#8217;s visit, witnessing
the nakedness of the land, she had kept Letty well
supplied with literature, English papers, and various
small matters, that made life more easy and refined.
Each year she most solemnly pledged herself to pay
a visit to Lucerne, and each year, the promised visit
was postponed; but now an event had occurred that
made her presence absolutely essential. The two
young people at Les Plans had grown up under
the same roof, and their mothers were secretly
anxious respecting their future; Frau Hurter was
particularly perturbed; gloomier, and more silent
than ever; since she did not fail to note how slyly
the beautiful Mitli played with, and fascinated her
distracted boy. Oh, it was a cat-and-mouse affair!
Fritz was crazy, he was under a witch&#8217;s spell, he could
settle to nothing. If Mitli was in Lucerne, so was he; if
she was at home, he hung about aimlessly, or took the<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_295"></a>[295]</span>
girl on the lake. He had become unmanageable, idle,
unfilial, ill-tempered. What would the end be,&mdash;and
when?</p>

<p>Of late Mitli&#8217;s popularity had cooled. Jost&#8217;s wife
openly hated her, and even Freda admitted that the
&#8216;kindli&#8217; never cared how much work she gave anyone.</p>

<p>One afternoon, as Frau Hurter stood in the doorway
watching the young couple descending the well-beaten
track, she suddenly made up her mind to
speak; and walking over to where Frau Glyn sat in
the shade absorbed in her lace pillow, she began:</p>

<p>&#8220;You see those two, <i>meine Frau</i>?&#8221; indicating the
rapidly disappearing pair. &#8220;Your girl and my boy.&#8221;</p>

<p>Letty looked up, followed the direction of the
speaker&#8217;s hand, and nodded and smiled&mdash;yet the
air and expression of Frau Hurter was portentous.</p>

<p>&#8220;They have grown up together in thirteen years
under the same roof&mdash;and now&#8221;&mdash;she paused, and
added with a dramatic gesture&mdash;&#8220;one of them must
go&mdash;and it cannot be my son.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Of course not,&#8221; agreed Letty, raising a bewildered
face to the stern and iron-willed Frau. &#8220;But I don&#8217;t
think I understand.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Have you then no eyes?&#8221; demanded the other
in a voice vibrating with passion, &#8220;not even the
mother&#8217;s eyes! My Fritz is madly&mdash;wickedly&mdash;in
love with your Mitli!&#8221;</p>

<p>Letty gave a stifled exclamation, hastily put aside
her work, and rose to her feet.</p>

<p>&#8220;Yes, he is; and more and more, and worse and<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_296"></a>[296]</span>
worse every time he comes home,&#8221; continued his
mother hoarsely; &#8220;and no wonder. Is there another
such face in the Four Cantons? But they are not for
one another&mdash;no, <i>never</i>!&#8221; and she stamped her heavy
foot upon the gravel. &#8220;She does not care for him,&#8221;
stooping to pick up an apple, &#8220;no, not this!&#8221; flinging
it away with a vicious jerk. &#8220;She does not care
for anyone. My tongue is quiet&mdash;but I use my eyes.
As for Fritz, he shall marry one of his own country,
a girl of his own class, strong, hard-working, with a
fortune&mdash;such there are. His cousin Gertrud, in the
Oberland, will suit me&mdash;and it has been arranged.
Meanwhile Mitli, whom he sees daily, goes to his head
like new beer, and the boy is as one drunken, and
mad! and so, <i>mein liebe Frau</i>, after many years
together, and I may say friendship, I must give you
notice to leave.&#8221;</p>

<p>For a moment or two Letty made no answer. Her
little world had been suddenly dissolved and was
whirling about her. She looked across the garden, and
its tall, white lilies and standard roses, to the familiar
brown house, with green shutters, then up at her
own open window&mdash;with its accustomed sponge,&mdash;her
haven for so long.</p>

<p>At last she said:</p>

<p>&#8220;Very well, I see your point of view, and I am
afraid Cara is inclined to be a flirt. The child likes to
make herself pleasant to everyone.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;No, not to everyone,&#8221; corrected the other bitterly.</p>

<p>&#8220;I am really very, very sorry if Fritz is attracted.<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_297"></a>[297]</span>
I honestly believed it was just the old boy-and-girl
liking.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Boy-and-girl liking, <i>Jesu Maria</i>! I&#8217;ve seen Fritz
kiss her empty shoes, I&#8217;ve known him watch her
window till dawn; these are the follies of his Italian
blood. I hoped Zurich would end them, but he is
worse. <i>Ach ye!</i> he is ten times worse! So now
I send him to a relative near Adelboden for some
time; there he will learn farming and good sense.
When he returns&mdash;&mdash;&#8221; She paused expressively.</p>

<p>&#8220;We shall have left, and to tell you the truth, Frau
Hurter, this move has been in my mind; but I love
Les Plans, and hate the idea of a change. I have
lately come into a legacy which brings me in one
hundred and fifty pounds a year, and as Cara believes
herself grown up, it is time that we go to
where she can mix with her own country-people. I
am undecided where to live, or what to do. I have
been rooted here for so long, that Les Plans seems
like my home.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Dear lady, it would, and gladly, be your home
for always&mdash;but for our two children. Young people,
will be young!&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Well, to-day I shall write to Mrs. Hesketh and
ask her advice,&#8221; said Letty, collecting her work.
&#8220;How soon must we move&mdash;in a week?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Oh, no; this is July&mdash;the end of September
would suit. Fritz will be away helping with the
harvest.&#8221; After a moment&#8217;s silence she added, &#8220;In
my mind I&#8217;ve long had this to say to you, <i>liebe Frau</i>,<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_298"></a>[298]</span>
and now, thanks be to God, it&#8217;s said,&#8221; and she turned
about, and went slowly indoors.</p>

<p>Letty followed her and ascended to her room,&mdash;there
to collect her ideas and make plans. She would be glad
to go, and yet here was the old weakness&mdash;sorry. At
Les Plans she had outward peace, occupation, her
walks, her books, and her letters from Lancelot. These
were mere pleasant epistles, such as a man would send
to a woman-friend, aunt, or sister-in-law, yet how she
treasured them. Accounts of balls and race meetings,
she read them over and over again, jealously searching
for a clue to some girl, the happy, happy, fortunate
girl, who would one day, take her place.&mdash;Then she
loved Switzerland and its beautiful scenery&mdash;with the
affection of a native. Cara, on the contrary, hated
the country and expressed herself to her mother with
scornful vehemence.</p>

<p>&#8220;I loathe these blue skies, blue mountains, blue
lake,&#8221; she announced. &#8220;They give me the blues!
As for the wonderful view, you rave about, I&#8217;d sooner
look at a picture postcard&mdash;<i>much</i> less fag!&#8221;</p>

<p>Letty presently sat down at her deal table, and
wrote to Mrs. Hesketh.</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>&#8220;Do try and come at once, best of friends, for I
want you urgently; and you know you promised to be
here this month, <i>sans faute</i>. Frau Hurter has just
given me notice to leave in September. Cara is now
a young lady, and full of ideas and ambitions. I
implore you to advise me, as to what will be best<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_299"></a>[299]</span>
for her? where we are to live? and what we are
to do?&#8221;</p></div>

<p>Meanwhile Cara and Fritz had gone upon the
lake in a superior new boat&mdash;a recent purchase.
As he rowed towards the Nasen, and she reclined
luxuriously in the stern, he told her of his mother&#8217;s
plans respecting himself and Gertrud, to which news
Cara listened with loud, derisive laughter, and a beaming
face. He also related how he was to lead a pastoral
life on the farm of a patriarchal relative&mdash;in order to
learn all the new methods.</p>

<p>&#8220;But when I come back in September you will be
here, Mitli, won&#8217;t you?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Why, of course,&#8221; she answered impatiently.
&#8220;Am I not always here?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;And you will write often&mdash;often&mdash;as before?
Swear it!&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Yes&mdash;often.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;If I thought you would ever care for anyone
else,&#8221;&mdash;and here the passion of jealousy flamed in
his Italian eyes&mdash;&#8220;I&#8217;d kill myself&mdash;if I had the
least doubt of <i>you</i>&mdash;I&#8217;d&#8221;&mdash;and he paused and leant
on his oars, and stared at Cara fiercely&mdash;&#8220;I&#8217;d
upset the boat, and drown us both, yes, in five
minutes!&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Don&#8217;t talk nonsense, Fritz! You know I am
fond of you. As to the drowning&mdash;you forget that
I can swim!&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Not if you are out here in the middle,&mdash;and in<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_300"></a>[300]</span>
your clothes&mdash;the water is too cold, and as to the
depth, the lake is bottomless.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Don&#8217;t talk like this, it bores me!&#8221; said Cara,&mdash;secretly
uneasy for all her sang-froid. She was aware
that Fritz was capable of mad, rash actions, carried
out on the impulse of the moment. To-day he looked
strange, very strange! The veins on his forehead stood
out like cord, and there was an odd light in his eyes.</p>

<p>&#8220;Come,&#8221; she continued authoritatively, &#8220;it is
time we are getting back; the sun is slipping behind
Pilatus. Keep out of this steamer&#8217;s wash, and row
to the landing,&#8221; and without another word he obeyed.</p>

<p>As the two slowly mounted the hill hand in hand,
half-way in the ascent, they halted on a little plateau
where, under some ancient pine trees, there was a
rough wooden bench,&mdash;a thoughtful provision not
uncommon in a land of views. Here Fritz said:</p>

<p>&#8220;My mother is all eyes, like the dog in the fairy tale.
She sees everything; but she will see me, my
own master before long. In a week I go,&mdash;and the
sooner I depart, the sooner I return to you, my Mitli,
and for always,&#8221; and he snatched her into his arms,
and kissed her passionately.</p>

<p>&#8220;Well, it pleased him, poor boy,&#8221; said Cara to
herself; &#8220;he was certainly extraordinarily handsome,
and what, after all, were a few kisses?&#8221;</p>

<h2 class="nobreak">CHAPTER XXIX</h2>
</div>


<p class="drop-cap">&#8220;MRS. HESKETH comes to-morrow,&#8221; her mother
announced to Cara, as she folded up a letter.
&#8220;I&#8217;m so glad, aren&#8217;t you?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;<i>Comme ca!</i>&#8221; she rejoined with a shrug. &#8220;<i>Moi
je n&#8217;aime pas les antiquities!</i>&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Oh, Cara! and she has always been so kind, and
generous to you.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;And why not? I am her goddaughter, the child
of her greatest friend. She has no one belonging to
her, and heaps of money. If she is so rich and so fond
of you, Mum, why does she let you board in a Swiss
farm-house, with barely enough money to pay for
<i>pension</i>, and work hard to make up the rest? She
ought to have us to live with her!&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;She would gladly&mdash;she has often invited us, but
I&#8217;ve refused. I cannot live on anyone, I must be
independent.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Then you and I differ, Mum. I am ready to live
on anyone who will give me a good time!&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Dear child, you are only joking, but for goodness&#8217;
sake don&#8217;t say such things before Mrs. Hesketh. She
might think you were serious.&#8221;</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>Mrs. Hesketh was visibly changed and aged; her<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_302"></a>[302]</span>
hair was grey, her step languid, her eyes, however,
still held their old fire.</p>

<p>The evening after her arrival, she and Letty sat in
the window of her sitting-room at the Paradis, which
overlooked the lake.</p>

<p>&#8220;I came at once, you see, my dear. If I had not
roused myself, I&#8217;d never have done it. As soon as
I&#8217;d read your letter I rang for Tomlin, told her to pack
and wire for places, and behold, me!&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;You look completely done up and frightfully tired.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I&#8217;m always done up and tired now; the fact is,
Letty, I&#8217;m an old woman.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Oh, don&#8217;t! You are <i>not</i>,&#8221; protested Letty with
unusual warmth.</p>

<p>&#8220;Yes, I am; my heart and brain may feel young,
but my body is aged. Age is a strange thing; it creeps
after us for years, and we go marching on, imagining
our youth or middle life will last. All at once, as in a
night, age springs out and seizes you&mdash;you look at
yourself in the glass, and it&#8217;s there,&mdash;or you hear it.
And I can assure you it is a shock! Some years ago
I was waiting to be served in a hairdresser&#8217;s, and I
overheard a man say to another:</p>

<p>&#8220;&#8216;You go&mdash;take the old lady first.&#8217;</p>

<p>&#8220;Until then I&#8217;d always thought myself merely
middle-aged; but I looked in the glass as the man
dressed my hair, and I said to myself, &#8216;He is right.
You <i>are</i> an old lady.&#8217; Once people used to stand up
and give me their seats, because I was lovely; now,
when they do this, it is merely because I am venerable,&#8221;<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_303"></a>[303]</span>
and she sighed profoundly. &#8220;And you, Letty, have
the gift of perpetual youth!&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;No, indeed; but I must say when I&#8217;m with you I
feel almost a girl, and when with Cara, I&#8217;m an elderly
woman.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;You are close on thirty-five and yet you look
seven-and-twenty&mdash;even in broad daylight. Your
calm, healthful, uneventful life, has preserved your
beauty. Such an existence would have driven <i>me</i> mad.
One day my body would have been fished out of the
lake.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;No, they are never found; the lake is pitiless.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Oh, well, before we begin to discuss your plans
and Cara&mdash;by the way, a handsome young woman!&mdash;let
me tell you all my news. The Dentons are pretty
much as usual, and send you kind messages. You
know that Frances is going to be married? I motored
over to Sharsley to lunch, and inspect the presents,&mdash;including
yours, and afterwards we walked up to the
Court. My dear, it&#8217;s like a dead place! Positively, I
expected to see a hearse at the door. The shutters
closed, the avenue grass-grown, not a soul to be met
or seen. I believe some of the best pictures and furniture
have been carted away, and sold. Old Scrope
heirlooms,&mdash;and the Scropes are frantic. Hugo&#8217;s racing
comes expensive. He and Tom Slater have a string of
useless animals, who, by all accounts, eat up thousands
and thousands.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;And where does he live?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;He has the same rooms in Newmarket, and the<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_304"></a>[304]</span>
house in town. Connie Rashleigh is often there,
though she still holds on to her own flat, as, of course,
she never knows when, and by whom, she may be deposed!
Cara inherits your colouring and teeth, but
she has her aunt&#8217;s figure, and her aunt&#8217;s laugh&mdash;yes,
and her father&#8217;s jaw.&#8221;</p>

<p>As Letty was about to protest:</p>

<p>&#8220;Yes, my dear, and her aunt&#8217;s air of buoyant confidence.
There is nothing undecided about Cara, and
I can grasp the fact, that she has her mother under her
thumb! Alas, poor Letty, you have merely changed
your yoke!&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Oh, dear Cousin Maude, you surely cannot judge
<i>already</i>!&#8221;</p>

<p>Mrs. Hesketh gave a quick nod; she had been in the
company of mother and daughter for several hours,
and had made copious notes.</p>

<p>&#8220;Do you think Cara is going to be a comfort to you?
and a compensation for all you have relinquished for
her sake?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Yes, of course I do,&#8221; replied Letty; but her colour
had risen, and her eyes no longer rested on her companion,
but on the moonlit lake, and a cargo-barge that
went drowsily by.</p>

<p>&#8220;Ah, that is good news!&#8221; said Mrs. Hesketh, but
her sardonic tone belied her speech. &#8220;And so you are
about to shift your sky at last&mdash;but why?&#8221;</p>

<p>In faltering and apologetic terms, Letty related her
interview with Frau Hurter, and the woman&#8217;s ultimatum.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_305"></a>[305]</span>&#8220;So Cara has been flirting, has she, and foolishly
encouraging the good-looking Fritz?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Not exactly that; but, you see, they grew up
together, and she is so gay, and unconventional, and
pretty.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Ah, well, of course, you must go&mdash;but where?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I am sure I don&#8217;t know. What do you advise?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I advise England.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;On two hundred pounds a year&mdash;impossible! And
now Cara is grown up she must be well dressed.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;So I see,&#8221; agreed Mrs. Hesketh, with significance.
&#8220;That embroidered linen never cost a sou less than one
hundred and fifty francs. Now, my advice is the same as
ever, come and live at Oldcourt. I want your company
badly; I&#8217;ve made a will, and left you every penny, so
you really <i>ought</i> to do something for me! As for
Cara, she shall go to a good finishing school in Brighton
for the next twelve months. I will, of course, pay
all her expenses. Seventeen is much too young for a
girl to come out into the world. You know that, Letty,
from your own experience&mdash;don&#8217;t you?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Yes, but Cara is different; she has decided views&mdash;no
one could talk or coerce her into anything she did
not wish to do.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Ah!&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;And she would laugh in your face, if you suggested
sending her to school.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Would she, indeed?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;You see, she has been at school at Mitzau, and
Lucerne, ever since she was eight.&#8221;</p>



<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_306"></a>[306]</span>&#8220;And what has she learnt, besides the art of holding
herself well, putting on her clothes, and offering her
crude opinions?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;She speaks French and German, she plays and
sings moderately, dances beautifully, and has won
several tennis, and swimming prizes.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;And considers her education complete. I see.
Well, we must take a little time, and talk things over;
when I know more of Cara, I may be better able to
help you to make up your mind. It is to give you this
assistance, I&#8217;ve come all the way to Lucerne.&#8221; Then,
speaking in another key, &#8220;Well, we shall meet to-morrow,
and if you will fetch me, I&#8217;ll toil up to the
farm, see how the land lies for myself, and have a look
at Fritz. Now, as I am feeling extra old and tired, I
must send you back to Les Plans,&mdash;for I am going
to my dear bed.&#8221;</p>

<h2 class="nobreak">CHAPTER XXX</h2>
</div>


<p class="drop-cap">MRS. HESKETH and her goddaughter had always
been secretly antagonistic to one another, and
as days went by, this feeling increased&mdash;especially on
the side of the girl, who, from a reluctant parent, had
extracted the fact that the meddling old woman suggested
sending her for one year to an English school!
Nevertheless she dissembled her sentiments,&mdash;for the
old hag was rich and had it in her power to offer motor
trips by land and water, and to give delightful <i>d&eacute;jeuners</i>
and dinners at the various fashionable hotels. Naturally
all these pleasures were for the sake of the Mum&mdash;but
she participated! At this season (early in July)
Lucerne was already full, and Cara, erect, well dressed,
and self-conscious, was sensible of being the admired
of many eyes, as she accompanied her two chaperons.
Occasionally she left them, and escaped to join her own
friends, Colette Vadier, Freda Muller, and Berthe Baer,
in picnics and teas. Her society was not missed, as
her mother and godmother had many matters to
discuss, that were not intended for her ears.</p>

<p>How and where the Glyns were to live? was a question
seriously debated. Letty still figuratively clung to the
Continent, and Mrs. Hesketh and Cara&mdash;for once in
accord&mdash;were strongly in favour of a home in England.<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_308"></a>[308]</span>
On this subject, the girl and her godmother, had some
talks, and on one of these rare occasions, Cara posed
as the poor exile, craving to see her native land, and
to live like other young women of her age and nation.</p>

<p>&#8220;Dear godmother,&#8221; she said effusively, &#8220;how I wish
you would use your influence with the Mum!&#8221; Then,
leaning her elbows on her knees, locking her hands,
and assuming a confidential attitude, she added, &#8220;To
me, it always seems so strange that we have no English
belongings, no letters except yours, and we have lived
at Les Plans for thirteen years! It almost looks&#8221;&mdash;she
spoke with bated breath, staring into her listener&#8217;s
face with eyes as hard as two blue glass marbles&mdash;&#8220;as
if&mdash;of course, only to you would I breathe it&mdash;&mdash;&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Well, breathe it!&#8221; urged Mrs. Hesketh impatiently.</p>

<p>&#8220;As if,&#8221; and Cara&#8217;s voice fell to an awed whisper,
&#8220;Mummy had&mdash;<i>done</i> something!&#8221;</p>

<p>Her godmother examined the girl from under her
beautifully marked brows, with a cold and critical
scrutiny. Was it for this disloyal wretch, that poor
Letty had sacrificed youth, and love, and country? Her
face was rigid as she answered:</p>

<p>&#8220;Your mother has her own excellent reasons for
living abroad. This life of labour and self-denial has
been for your sake; for you, she has made great sacrifices.
I hope you are grateful, Cara?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Oh, yes,&#8221; with a shrug; &#8220;<i>cela va sans dire</i>; but
I&#8217;m her only child, and it&#8217;s her business to look
after me. Of course, she can&#8217;t help being poor, or
afford to give me a good time, but I&#8217;m sure we could<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_309"></a>[309]</span>
struggle along somehow in London. I&#8217;ve heard that it&#8217;s
the cheapest place in the world, and I am so deadly
sick of that odious Les Plans, with its horrible smell
of cows and cheese; when there is a hitch about
supplies, we have sausages, and smoked meat, and nasty
Swiss messes. And, oh, I&#8217;m so tired of looking out on
the opposite shore of the lake, with its black woods,
grey mountains, and skim-milk sky. Give <i>me</i> a good
street!&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;But, after all, Cara, you are not much at home;
latterly you have lived chiefly in Lucerne, and I know
you have visited Berne, Zurich, Interlaken, and
Lugano.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Yes&mdash;Switzerland&mdash;<i>toujours Suisse</i>! I am crazy
to get out of this corner, and to see the world.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;You cannot expect to see much of the world on
two hundred a year, can you? and you should think
of your mother.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Of course, but the Mum&mdash;well, she is no longer
young, and she has had <i>her</i> day&mdash;now I want to have
mine!&#8221;</p>

<p>So poor Letty&#8217;s attempts to satisfy the girl had been
a failure; the influence of devotion, self-sacrifice, and
example, was powerless against the giant Heredity.</p>

<p>In mid-July there was a grand f&ecirc;te in Lucerne, and
Mrs. Hesketh invited Letty and her encumbrance to
a concert at the Casino, dinner at the National, and
subsequently to see the illuminations, and return
home by motor-boat.</p>

<p>This programme was faithfully accomplished; at dinner<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_310"></a>[310]</span>
in the restaurant of the hotel, Letty and her girl,
were distinguished among a vast cosmopolitan crowd.
When their coffee-cups had been emptied, Cara, in her
most persuasive manner, asked leave to run away.</p>

<p>&#8220;I want,&#8221; she said, &#8220;to go up to the Drei Linden
and sit with Berthe, who is ill in bed with an abscess in
her face. I&#8217;ll be back before you know I&#8217;m gone;
I&#8217;ve seen the fireworks, and the lighting up of the old
bridge, a thousand times, so if I&#8217;m late, please don&#8217;t
worry. I shall probably stay and try to cheer up poor
old Berthe.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;But, my dear Cara, should you be going about
<i>alone</i> at this hour?&#8221; asked Mrs. Hesketh in a tone of
alarm.</p>

<p>&#8220;What&mdash;in Lucerne! I should hope so. I know it
from end to end, and I shall be perfectly <i>safe</i>, if that is
why you are anxious.&#8221;</p>

<p>When Cara had resumed her hat and scarf, the two
ladies walked with her to the entrance of the hotel,
and watched her trip across the tram-line, and vanish
by the corner of the English church.</p>

<p>&#8220;You see, the child has a kind heart,&#8221; said Letty,
&#8220;and is ready to give up a gay evening, to go and sit
with her sick friend.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Yes,&#8221; agreed Mrs. Hesketh; &#8220;I own I am&mdash;&mdash;&#8221;
she was about to say &#8216;surprised,&#8217; but hastily substituted
the word &#8216;impressed.&#8217; &#8220;Now, we may as well
go on the Quai, and see what is to be seen.&#8221;</p>

<p>As it happened there was a good deal to be seen, not
merely the fiery outline of the bridge and towers, the<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_311"></a>[311]</span>
lights on Pilatus and Stanserhorn, but numbers of
lively little boats carrying Chinese lanterns; they
looked like swarms of fire-flies. The Quai was almost
impassable, so thronged was it with a gay, gaily dressed,
chattering crowd; sightseers, townsfolk, and the
contents of various hotels, were all enjoying the
brilliant scene, and the delicious evening.</p>

<p>The two friends were interested and amused: time
passed quickly, the Hof Kirche clock struck ten, and
yet there was no sign of Cara. She had been gone
considerably more than an hour,&mdash;an hour and a
half.</p>

<p>&#8220;At what time did you order the motor-boat?&#8221;
asked Letty, who began to be uneasy. As Mrs. Hesketh
uttered the word &#8216;eleven&#8217; a sudden flood of
rose-coloured light illuminated the entire scene. For
a moment, every object was visible with the clearest
distinctness, the ruddy glow recalled a transformation
spectacle. By its assistance, the ladies beheld, close at
hand, a small skiff carrying a jaunty orange lantern,
and in the boat were a young couple; a man, who was
twanging a mandoline, whilst a laughing girl managed
the oars with practised dexterity. All at once the
man bent towards her&mdash;and then the light failed.</p>

<p>Letty gave an audible gasp.</p>

<p>&#8220;I&mdash;could I be mistaken?&#8221; She turned on her companion
a face of horror.</p>

<p>&#8220;No, I&#8217;m afraid not. Four eyes are better than two&mdash;that
was Cara rowing about with&mdash;Berthe Baer!
From what I have gathered in the few days I&#8217;ve been<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_312"></a>[312]</span>
at the Paradis, Cara has been throwing dust in your
eyes for years.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Oh, Cousin Maude&mdash;you&mdash;you&mdash;talk to Tomlin!&#8221;
cried Letty with indignation.</p>

<p>&#8220;No, my dear, but Frau Hurter has been talking to
<i>me</i>. Her son&#8217;s raging jealousy aroused her suspicions,
and she has kept her eyes open.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;But Cara is only a foolish, wild, headstrong child!&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Child no longer, Letty, but a young woman who
is not to be trusted.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;What am I to do?&#8221; faltered her friend helplessly.</p>

<p>&#8220;At present, nothing; you must take a leaf out of
Cara&#8217;s book, and pretend we have not seen her&mdash;remember
that.&#8221;</p>

<p>And in accordance with this advice, no remark was
made when twenty minutes later, a breathless Cara
scrambled into the motor-boat, full of voluble excuses
and soft caresses for her sweet Mum. &#8220;Berthe had
been so ill and miserable&mdash;she had not dared to leave
her till she slept. She knew her darling Mum would
forgive her, and she had run every step of the way
down the Drei Linden, and nearly broken her neck!&#8221;</p>

<p>As the motor-boat squattered off from the stage, a
figure stepped out from under the trees, waving a
handkerchief, and a manly voice shouted a hearty
&#8220;<i>Auf wiedersehen!</i>&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;What a funny man! Who is he shouting to?
Were the illuminations good?&#8221; enquired the still
breathless Cara with an air of innocent curiosity.</p>

<p>&#8220;Yes, I think so,&#8221; replied Mrs. Hesketh.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_313"></a>[313]</span>&#8220;And were there the usual little boats with lanterns?&#8221;</p>

<p>Here indeed was audacity!</p>

<p>&#8220;Oh, yes, the usual little boats.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I&#8217;ve not missed much&mdash;nothing strange or uncommon?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Oh, yes, there was,&#8221; began Mrs. Hesketh, speaking
with rash significance; but a pressure from her
friend&#8217;s hand restrained further explanation, and she
muttered, &#8220;Of course, it was <i>all</i> a novelty to me.&#8221;</p>

<p>Had Cara not been so intensely absorbed in her own
amusing reflections, she might have marvelled at the
unusual silence of her two companions. Scarcely a
word was exchanged, as the boat raced across the
moon-flooded lake in the direction of their distant
destination.</p>

<h2 class="nobreak">CHAPTER XXXI</h2>
</div>


<p class="drop-cap">TWO days before the f&ecirc;te, Mrs. Hesketh had made
the unwelcome discovery, that Mrs. and Miss
Plassy were again her fellow guests. Many years had
elapsed since they met at the Californie, Cannes;
but her memory was only too retentive. There was no
forgetting the tall, faded woman with a stoop, and the
agreeable, gushing daughter. From her shady seat in
the grounds, she had witnessed their arrival; and as
one after the other, the ladies descended from the hotel
bus, she was sensible of a distinct, and disagreeable
shock. Supposing the Plassys were to meet and
recognise Letty?&mdash;Letty, so little changed!</p>

<p>Undoubtedly Mrs. Plassy was a conscientious
student of the daily press; would she proclaim to all
and sundry that here in seclusion and sheep&#8217;s clothing
was the notorious divorc&eacute;e, who had kidnapped her
child? And if so, what then?</p>

<p>As regarded herself, she would infinitely prefer to
ignore these birds of Passage and of Prey; but for
her friend&#8217;s sake, it behoved her to walk warily, conceal
their arrival from her, and at all hazards keep them in
ignorance of Letty&#8217;s vicinity.</p>

<p>As might be expected, Mrs. Plassy&#8217;s first duty on
arriving at an hotel, was to scrutinise the list of guests.<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_315"></a>[315]</span>
As her eye travelled over an open page in the Visitors&#8217;
Book of the Paradis, her attention was arrested by
the name of &#8216;Hesketh.&#8217; &#8216;Mrs. Carlton Hesketh and
maid. England.&#8217; Yes, it must be the same; a hateful,
supercilious woman, whom it had been impossible to
placate; a woman who declined to approach when a
vacant seat near Mrs. Plassy was patted invitingly,
and when endowed with a card, and address, made no
appropriate return. Such a creature was altogether
insupportable, and she decided to ignore her existence.
However, this amiable intention was frustrated by Mrs.
Hesketh coming up to her in the lounge, and claiming
her acquaintance. She was actually quite gracious
and friendly, and made flattering enquiries respecting
her health, and her plans. (It was good news to the
hypocritical widow, that the Plassys were moving on
to Lucerne in a day or two; they were merely stopping
at the Paradis awaiting the arrival of a friend.)</p>

<p>Thirteen years had passed over the heads of this
roving couple, and had treated them with callous
cruelty. Time had not brought a suitor to the feet of
Miss Lydia, and on the other hand he had robbed her
of her lively spirits, and a certain amount of colour and
hair. Lydia was a discontented, embittered woman
who had missed her way in life, and was nearing the
lamentable frontier of forty. She had a good figure, an
acid tongue (but could make herself agreeable), and a
positive genius for dress. Lydia and her mother were
sincerely devoted to one another. Proud, poor,
ambitious, they contrived to make a brave show on an<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_316"></a>[316]</span>
income that would seem incredibly small in proportion
to their pretensions, and manner of living. Their
appearance and dress were ultra-fashionable, they
proclaimed to envious listeners, that they had discovered
a secret treasure of a &#8216;little&#8217; dressmaker&mdash;but
the truth was, their smart gowns were second, and even
third hand&mdash;and as a rule, their choice of hotels and
acquaintances were fastidious and select. Lydia
announced that they were obliged to live abroad on
account of her mother&#8217;s health; whilst the supposed
invalid exerted her failing strength in order to get
her dear girl settled. She frequented Alpine resorts,
famous for winter sports, popular cures, or the Riviera,
and, in short, any hunting-ground favoured by the
eligible British bachelor.</p>

<p>In order to effect these costly adventures, the Plassys
were at times obliged to exercise the most rigid
economies. They haunted cheap <i>pensions</i>, where they
shared a room for eight francs a day&mdash;food and light,
<i>tout compris</i>. Here they made their own tea with an
Etna, here they washed their handkerchiefs and
stockings, here they wore out their old clothes, and, so
to speak, girded themselves for their next encounter
with Fortune.</p>

<p>The ladies had come to the too-expensive Paradis,
in pursuit of a very distant connection, a valetudinarian
old bachelor of enormous wealth and many whims and
fancies&mdash;in the hope, that Lydia might prove to be one
of them!</p>

<p>The afternoon succeeding the f&ecirc;te, Letty, unaware<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_317"></a>[317]</span>
of any lurking pitfalls, descended to the Paradis,
accompanied by Cara, and Mrs. Hesketh, with a tremor
in her heart, invited them to tea in a retired summer-house
in the grounds. Here they would be safe. As
she sipped weak tea, she noticed Letty&#8217;s haggard white
face, testifying to a sleepless night, the girl&#8217;s feverish
restlessness, and roving, dissatisfied eyes. It had long
been planned that Tomlin was to have &#8216;an afternoon
in Lucerne,&#8217; accompanied by Cara as companion and
courier, since the British maid could not speak a word
of any language but her own. They were to visit the
panoramas, the museum, and the shops, and details
of the expedition were being finally discussed, when
Mrs. Plassy and her daughter strolled by arm in arm.
For a moment Mrs. Hesketh&#8217;s heart stood still, then
throbbed on&mdash;the danger had passed! No&mdash;by bad
luck Cara gave one of her loud, somewhat foolish
laughs&mdash;her mother had spilt her tea.</p>

<p>Mrs. Plassy deliberately halted, turned about, and
approached.</p>

<p>&#8220;Oh, dear Mrs. Hesketh,&#8221; she exclaimed, with
lifted hands, &#8220;how charming you all look! How
much pleasanter to have tea out of doors.&#8221; Then,
glancing at Letty, she paused, and in a different
key added, &#8220;I think I have met&mdash;Mrs.&mdash;er&mdash;Mrs.&mdash;&mdash;&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Glyn,&#8221; added Mrs. Hesketh precipitately.</p>

<p>&#8220;Oh, yes,&#8221; with a slight bow, and steadily regarding
her she added, with deadly significance:</p>

<p>&#8220;<i>I know!</i>&#8221;</p>



<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_318"></a>[318]</span>Then, turning to her daughter, &#8220;Lyddy, you have
met Mrs. Glyn at Cannes.&#8221;</p>

<p>Lyddy smiled and stared&mdash;her expression implied
that she, too, knew all.</p>

<p>&#8220;And this young lady?&#8221; she asked, turning to Cara.</p>

<p>&#8220;My daughter,&#8221; replied Letty in a faint voice.</p>

<p>&#8220;Are you staying here, Mrs. Glyn?&#8221; enquired Mrs.
Plassy, and her tone was frigid and judicial. &#8220;I did
not see your name in the hotel list.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Oh, no,&#8221; broke in Cara, attracted by these fashionable
strangers, &#8220;we live in a farm up the hill, called
Les Plans.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;How absolutely delightful!&#8221; murmured Miss
Plassy. &#8220;It must be so healthy&mdash;and so secluded,&#8221;
and she threw Letty a significant glance.</p>

<p>&#8220;No, it&#8217;s horrid!&#8221; declared Cara rebelliously.</p>

<p>&#8220;Won&#8217;t you sit down, and have some tea?&#8221; urged
Mrs. Hesketh (who appreciated the crisis at its full
value). &#8220;There is plenty of room, and I&#8217;ll send for
more cups.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I&#8217;ve finished,&#8221; announced Cara, rising as she spoke
and offering her seat to Mrs. Plassy, who sank into it
with an air of satisfaction, saying to herself as she
drew off her gloves, &#8220;This will save me three francs!&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I don&#8217;t want any tea, thank you,&#8221; said Lydia
Plassy, &#8220;so Miss Glyn and I will stroll about, and make
one another&#8217;s acquaintance.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Yes, a capital idea!&#8221; assented her parent. &#8220;Do
you two girls go off and amuse one another, and we old
people will talk of old times.&#8221;</p>



<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_319"></a>[319]</span>Thus dismissed, the girl of seventeen and the girl of
thirty-seven, walked away laughing and chattering.
Their dress was almost identical&mdash;white gowns, large
hats wreathed with flowers; the sole difference being
that Cara wore roses, and her companion a wreath of
daisies.</p>

<p>Meanwhile, Mrs. Hesketh and her friend proved poor
enough company for a guest who was filled with a
burning curiosity,&mdash;and they with a sense of icy terror.</p>

<p>Mrs. Plassy knew everything; was her daughter
in the secret? If so, would she tell <i>Cara</i>?</p>

<p>The bare idea caused Letty to feel faint! the child
had always been led to suppose that her father was
dead; this fact, never actually stated, was nevertheless
implied. She followed the two white figures with straining
eyes, and a wildly beating heart, whilst her friend
and Mrs. Plassy discoursed of hotels, and society. The
latter lady pointedly excluded Mrs. Glyn from the
conversation; her attitude was rigid, her glance
expressed hostility, and disdain.</p>

<p>The miserable culprit realised, that she was meeting
the eyes of a world, who was still crying shame upon
her, and measured the amount of condemnation that
awaited her in circles where her story was known. Of
late years this fact had slumbered.&mdash;At last the tension
and situation became unendurable, and with a murmured
excuse she rose, and moved away in search
of the two girls.</p>

<p>&#8220;How young she looks!&#8221; exclaimed Mrs. Plassy.
Then, in reply to a glance, &#8220;I mean Mrs. Blagdon.&#8221;</p>



<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_320"></a>[320]</span>&#8220;Hush!&#8221; with a horrified gesture; &#8220;I&#8217;ve not
heard that name for years.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I suppose,&#8221; resumed the other, and her manner
was aggressive, &#8220;she has buried herself at the farm, on
account of the child?&#8221;</p>

<p>Mrs. Hesketh nodded.</p>

<p>&#8220;Does the girl know?&#8221; she asked abruptly.</p>

<p>&#8220;Not yet.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Ah; when she finds out that she is the only child
of a very rich man, I don&#8217;t think <i>I</i> should care to be
in her mother&#8217;s shoes!&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Don&#8217;t you?&#8221; retorted Mrs. Hesketh. &#8220;Her
mother has forfeited her income, her country, her
friends, and devoted her life to her&mdash;is that to count
for nothing?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I&#8217;m afraid that young people are shockingly selfish
and ungrateful&mdash;especially when they are the objects of
schemes for their good,&#8221; replied Mrs. Plassy, who was
thoroughly enjoying herself, and determined that this
detestable enemy should be remorselessly tortured.
&#8220;She looks to me like a girl who had expensive tastes,
and would appreciate luxury!&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;You don&#8217;t know Hugo Blagdon,&#8221; declared Mrs.
Hesketh, with a note of passion in her voice, &#8220;nor
the bringing up that he would have given his
daughter!&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Yes, by all accounts he is a <i>viveur!</i> and he looks
dissipated. I&#8217;ve seen him at Monte Carlo. Yet, after
all, the girl is legally his; he is her father.&#8221; A sharpness
came into her speech, as she added, &#8220;Who would believe<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_321"></a>[321]</span>
that that quiet young woman, had it <i>in</i> her to run off,
first with an officer, and then with her own child?
Still waters run deep!&#8221;</p>

<p>So this was how people talked of her friend!</p>

<p>Mrs. Hesketh&#8217;s temper was simmering to boiling-point;
she began to realise that her adversary had set
her heavy heel upon her neck, and intended to keep it
there.</p>

<p>&#8220;I must say that it has been a great thing for Mrs.
Blagdon&mdash;I mean Glyn&mdash;to have had your support,&#8221;
continued Mrs. Plassy condescendingly.</p>

<p>&#8220;She is my friend&mdash;the best, most unselfish, and
pure-minded woman, I have ever known.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Yes, yes&mdash;how splendid of you to say so! I daresay
Mrs. Glyn was not <i>quite</i> as much to blame as people
made out.&#8221; (But in Mrs. Plassy&#8217;s tone there lurked a
reservation.) &#8220;And you, dear lady, are so unusually
broad-minded&mdash;I have always maintained this.&#8221;</p>

<p>Mrs. Hesketh swallowed her fury, and steadied her
voice, resolved to come to an understanding with this
odious woman at all costs.</p>

<p>&#8220;Cara knows nothing of the past as yet, and it is
her mother&#8217;s wish and mine, that she remains in
ignorance of it&mdash;for the present.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Your wishes are natural. If her mother&#8217;s story
leaked out here, it would be so awkward for the poor
girl; and no doubt the farm people might make
difficulties. I suppose, according to our English law,
Mrs.&mdash;Glyn&mdash;is still liable to criminal prosecution?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;There is no fear of that,&#8221; replied Mrs. Hesketh,<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_322"></a>[322]</span>
speaking with sharp irritation; &#8220;<i>no</i> effort was made to
recover Cara. Her father was thankful to be rid of
her.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;She is a fine-looking young woman, on a rather
large scale. I daresay as she grows older, she will
become like her aunt&mdash;too fleshy!&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;May be so; at present, the important matter is,
that she should not hear that she has an aunt&mdash;or a
father.&#8221;</p>

<p>The two women gazed at one another in silence.
Then Mrs. Hesketh, mentally shuddering, prostrated
herself in the dust. &#8220;Mrs. Plassy, you are the only
acquaintance who knows our secret, and if you will
keep it&mdash;I shall look upon it as the greatest <i>personal</i>
favour.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Of course you may rely upon us, dear Mrs. Hesketh,&#8221;
replied the other coldly. &#8220;Not a breath shall
the child hear; as a matter of fact, we are leaving
early to-morrow for Lucerne. Our cousin finds the
hotel too near the lake, and insists on our accompanying
him.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Your promise is extremely kind,&#8221; said Mrs. Hesketh,
&#8220;for we do not wish to disturb the present
position until matters are settled in England. And if
I, in any way, can do <i>you</i> a good turn, you have only to
name it&mdash;now or later; you will find that I can show,&#8221;
here she looked into her opponent&#8217;s faded eyes with
peculiar significance, &#8220;<i>substantial</i> gratitude for a
friendly silence.&#8221;</p>

<p>In that exchange of glances, how much had been said<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_323"></a>[323]</span>
and answered! Mrs. Plassy, a faithful interpreter,
felt a warm glow of satisfaction. That expressive
gaze conveyed a promise to pay, and an I.O.U. of
considerable value&mdash;it implied, and was good for,
introductions, entertainments, prestige, and&mdash;loans.</p>

<p>&#8220;I am sure I shall be glad of any kindness,&#8221; she
murmured with lowered eyelids; &#8220;and you have so
<i>much</i> in your power.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;At any rate, you may reckon on me,&#8221; declared
Mrs. Hesketh, rising from her chair. &#8220;I have a
number of letters that I really must write for this
post,&mdash;and I am sure you will excuse me?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Of course, of course&mdash;with pleasure.&#8221; Which was
not precisely the right rejoinder. Then Mrs. Hesketh
walked away across the grass, carrying her
still slender figure with unusual dignity, though her
hands were shaking, and her face was chalk-white. She
felt utterly shattered, prostrated, and disgraced, by
the recent humiliating interview.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>Two days later Cara and Tomlin proceeded to Lucerne
for the promised outing. They accomplished a good
deal of shopping and sight-seeing, and Tomlin proved
wildly extravagant with respect to chocolate, picture
postcards, and cheap brooches; but at the end of
two hours, the girl&#8217;s patience was threadbare; she was
bored to death. She hated interpreting, bargaining,
and standing before shop-windows,&mdash;the contents of
which she knew by heart,&mdash;and hailed with joy the<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_324"></a>[324]</span>
approach of Lydia Plassy, who halted, and accosted
her.</p>

<p>&#8220;What are you doing in Lucerne?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Nothing; we have been shopping, and looking at
panoramas, and the old bridge, and the museum.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;How <i>very</i> exciting!&#8221; She glanced at Tomlin, who
stood transfixed before some exquisite embroideries.
&#8220;It is getting on for four. Do come along and have
tea with me at Huguenin&#8217;s? She,&#8221; nodding at the
maid, &#8220;can easily amuse herself, and meet you at the
boat.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I should love it,&#8221; said Cara eagerly, then added in
French, &#8220;She&#8217;s my policeman&mdash;and I&#8217;ll only be too
thankful to be rid of her. She&#8217;s just an old spy.&#8221;</p>

<p>Miss Plassy graciously explained the situation to
Tomlin&mdash;who recognising the lady as an hotel acquaintance
of her mistress, agreed; by no means reluctant,
to have an hour to spend as she pleased, and to be left
to enjoy the shop-windows to her heart&#8217;s content.</p>

<p>Her mother had told Lydia,&mdash;from whom she had
no secrets,&mdash;of her conversation with Mrs. Hesketh,
and the promise and understanding which now
existed between them.</p>

<p>&#8220;Hateful old woman, so disgustingly stuck up!
Have you forgotten her airs and snubs at Cannes?&#8221;
said Lydia spitefully. &#8220;Now she wants something
badly she is as sweet as honey&mdash;bah! such people
make me ill. She asks you a great favour&mdash;yes&mdash;but
what can she do for <i>us</i>?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;My dear,&#8221; replied her mother, with impressive<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_325"></a>[325]</span>
solemnity, &#8220;you know very well, that she has it in
her power, to be a <i>very</i> helpful friend.&#8221;</p>

<p>But it was not merely the snubs that still rankled in
Lydia&#8217;s mind&mdash;she was accustomed to these; it was
the never-forgotten fact, that a charming young man,
who was her devoted adherent, had been drawn from
his allegiance by the arrival of the mysterious beauty,
Mrs. Hesketh&#8217;s companion; and though the beauty
never vouchsafed him a crumb of encouragement, the
capricious swain had failed to return to Lydia&#8217;s lure;
Mrs. Glyn had unintentionally cost Miss Plassy her
lover.</p>

<p>&#8220;<i>I&#8217;ve</i> made no promises,&#8221; said this lady to herself,
&#8220;and if I get a chance, I shall pay them both out&mdash;Mrs.
Nose-in-the-Air, and the divorc&eacute;e.&#8221;</p>

<p>Now here was the &#8216;chance&#8217; looking so beaming and
pleased with herself, as she tripped beside her hostess,
along the Liongasse; and with this girl as the instrument,
Miss Plassy felt certain she could inflict
satisfactory punishment upon her mother. How she
talked! chattering all the time, and bubbling over
with the <i>joie de vivre</i>.</p>

<p>&#8220;Yes, thank you,&#8221; said Cara, as they seated themselves,
&#8220;a P&ecirc;che Melba&mdash;I adore ices!&#8221; She removed
her gloves, and settled her hat with swift instinctive
touches; and presently the two were exchanging confidences
as they sat <i>vis-&agrave;-vis</i> across the marble-topped
table, awaiting their order.</p>

<p>&#8220;We are going on to St. Moritz next week,&#8221; announced
Miss Plassy.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_326"></a>[326]</span>&#8220;Are you? How I envy you! We never go on.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;No? But why not?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Because we are so poor.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;We are poor too&mdash;church mice aren&#8217;t in it!&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;But not like us; we have not enough money to
travel, or to live in England.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Come, come, my dear girl,&#8221; protested Lyddy, suddenly
planting her elbows on the table, and staring into
her face, &#8220;don&#8217;t be a little ostrich! Surely you know&mdash;ah,
here come our P&ecirc;che Melbas at last!&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;About what?&#8221; enquired Cara, plunging in her
ready spoon.</p>

<p>&#8220;About your <i>mother</i>, my dear.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;My mother! What about her?&#8221; The girl&#8217;s face
was expressive of profound indifference.</p>

<p>&#8220;Can&#8217;t you guess? Well, look here, promise me
you won&#8217;t ever give me away?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;All right,&#8221; agreed Cara with a nod. &#8220;I can keep a
secret&mdash;I know lots!&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Tell me, have you never wondered, why you live
out here?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Yes, but I&#8217;ve told you the reason.&mdash;We are so disgustingly
poor.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Not really poor; your father is enormously rich,
actually rolling in money.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I don&#8217;t know what you are talking about!&#8221; protested
Cara querulously. &#8220;You are thinking of other
people&mdash;<i>my</i> father is dead,&#8221; and she took another
spoonful of ice.</p>

<p>&#8220;Well, yes, in a way. He <i>is</i> dead to your mother.&#8221;</p>



<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_327"></a>[327]</span>Cara gazed at the speaker blankly, her eyes became
round, the pupils looked like two small spots.</p>

<p>&#8220;Listen to me,&#8221; and as Miss Plassy leant across the
table, spoon in hand, her voice was emphatic, and her
manner forcible. &#8220;You must know some time, and I
may as well tell you&mdash;<i>they</i> never will!&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Tell me what?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Why, about your father and mother,&#8221; a pause,
followed by a dramatic whisper, &#8220;<i>he divorced her</i>.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Miss Plassy, how dare you!&#8221; Cara&#8217;s face was
crimson. &#8220;I don&#8217;t believe you,&#8221; she added hysterically.</p>

<p>&#8220;Oh, very well, please yourself, my dear,&#8221; she
replied with a mixture of malice and gaiety. &#8220;The
case was in all the papers, fourteen years ago. People
in England knew all about it,&mdash;and my mother
remembers it perfectly.&#8221;</p>

<p>Cara suddenly pushed away her plate, she was
trembling violently, her lips quivered. Was she going
to cry?</p>

<p>&#8220;I&#8217;m so sorry you are upset,&#8221; continued the informer;
&#8220;but to open your eyes is the truest kindness.
I can&#8217;t imagine how they have kept it from you, all
these years.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Kept what from me?&#8221; demanded the girl in a
choking voice. &#8220;I can&#8217;t think why you are telling me
these awful things. I believe you are inventing them.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Your father&#8217;s name is Blagdon&mdash;so is yours,&#8221;
announced Miss Plassy with bland composure. &#8220;Hugo
Blagdon of Sharsley Court, a magnificent place in<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_328"></a>[328]</span>
Yorkshire. He is enormously rich; they say he has
forty thousand a year&mdash;pounds&mdash;not <i>francs</i>!&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Oh!&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;And you are his only child, and heiress.&#8221;</p>

<p>Cara&#8217;s amazement was such, that she was unable to
utter a word, but her face worked convulsively. At
last she stammered:</p>

<p>&#8220;This is a joke!&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Not at all; I only wish it were my joke! When
you were about three years old, your mother ran away
with a good-looking officer, I forget his name; he did
not marry her, and went to India. Afterwards, she and
Mrs. Hesketh travelled about together, and we met
them at Cannes. Later on, we saw in the papers that
your mother had kidnapped you, from your nurse,
and disappeared,&mdash;and here you are! What a funny
chance coming across you at the Paradis!&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;So that&#8217;s the story&mdash;and it&#8217;s all true?&#8221;</p>

<p>Cara&#8217;s eyes glittered with excitement, her soft pink
cheeks, were paler than usual.</p>

<p>&#8220;True as gospel,&#8221; replied her companion emphatically;
&#8220;as true as I am sitting here. If your father
knew of your whereabouts, he would certainly claim
you, and give you a ripping time. You might ask me
to stay?&#8221; she added playfully. &#8220;You would have
motors, balls, racing, a town house, a country house.
I only wish <i>I</i> had a chance of standing in your shoes!&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I declare you have made me feel quite giddy,&#8221;
and Cara put her hand to her head; &#8220;but I understand
a lot of things&mdash;<i>now</i>.&#8221;</p>



<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_329"></a>[329]</span>&#8220;Yes, I suppose you do.&mdash;You look pretty wide-awake.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I see why we have no English friends, except Mrs.
Hesketh&mdash;whom I hate, and who never ceases asking
bothering questions, and making nasty speeches, and
tells me, that I can never repay the Mum for all she
has done for me.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Done you out of, she means!&#8221; briskly corrected
Miss Plassy.</p>

<p>&#8220;And I remember a man we met ages ago on the
Fluellen boat; awfully good-looking; he and mother
seemed so amazed to see one another. He was going
to India, and they had such a talk. After he left, the
Mum cried a lot. I think his name was Lumley.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;That&#8217;s the man she ran away with!&#8221; declared
Miss Plassy triumphantly.</p>

<p>&#8220;And now after hearing all this, I&#8217;ve got to go home
to the Mum and face her! I don&#8217;t see how I can ever
forgive her; she has spoiled my life. Oh,&#8221; and her
voice was broken with emotion, &#8220;when I think of all
I have missed, since I was a kid, it&#8217;s too, too, awful!&#8221;
and large tears welled from Cara&#8217;s hard blue eyes.</p>

<p>&#8220;It will all come right some day,&#8221; said the other
soothingly. &#8220;Why, you are only seventeen, and not
even out yet. Your mother just wanted you all to
herself, you see. <i>Do</i> finish your ice.&#8221;</p>

<p>Cara felt that under the circumstances, it would be
more dignified to leave the ice untouched,&mdash;but it was
characteristic of her, that she gobbled down the remainder
of the P&ecirc;che Melba, and left an empty plate.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_330"></a>[330]</span>&#8220;Of course, I know that I may rely on you to keep
what you have heard to yourself?&#8221; continued her
companion,&mdash;Miss Plassy had thoroughly enjoyed this
interview;&mdash;a most pernicious satisfaction! but were
the details to reach the ear of Mrs. Hesketh, the result
might prove unpleasant, and a hinted-at reward be
inflexibly withheld.</p>

<p>&#8220;Yes, you may be sure I shall hold my tongue and
lie low for the present. It was awfully kind of you to
tell me, and if&mdash;if&mdash;what you say ever comes true, you
must stay with me and have a ripping time.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;All right, I&#8217;ll remind you!&#8221; responded Lydia
gaily.&mdash;(How delightful to kill two birds with one
stone, and receive grateful acknowledgments from two
quarters.) &#8220;There&#8217;s five o&#8217;clock striking now,&#8221; she
added, rising as she spoke; &#8220;if you want to catch the
boat, you must run for your life; here is your parasol&mdash;here
are your gloves&mdash;fly!&#8221;</p>

<h2 class="nobreak">CHAPTER XXXII</h2>
</div>


<p class="drop-cap">IT was at a late hour for Les Plans, when Letty,
seeing a light, timidly pushed open the kitchen
door, and beheld Frau Hurter bending over the table,
iron in hand, and oh, happy opportunity, alone! She
was nervously anxious to have a little private talk
about Cara&mdash;but how to begin?</p>

<p>&#8220;I wonder if you would mind pressing this?&#8221; she
enquired, exhibiting a strip of delicate embroidery.
&#8220;See, it is finished at last.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Yes,&#8221; assented Frau Hurter, straightening herself,
taking it from her, and examining it carefully.
&#8220;Beautiful work,&mdash;and should fetch a good price.&#8221;</p>

<p>(&#8216;A good price&#8217; was her <i>ne plus ultra</i> of attainment.)</p>

<p>&#8220;It is for a blouse for Mitli.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Ah&mdash;true&mdash;everything is for Mitli.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I&#8217;m afraid she is out of favour with you?&#8221;
ventured her mother timidly.</p>

<p>&#8220;Ach ye! She is indeed changed. It is another
Mitli, <i>Mein Frau</i>. I have eyes and ears, and I hear
tales&mdash;half of them I do not believe&mdash;for I still love the
<i>kindli</i>&mdash;I cannot help myself.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;What have you heard? I implore you to tell me.
Who has been talking?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Elizabeth Baer for one. I met her a few days ago<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_332"></a>[332]</span>
at market, and she came over and spoke, and said that
Mitli is a Wustus Madel, and had a bad influence on
her girl Berthe&mdash;she had forbidden her the house!&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;No!&#8221; ejaculated Letty in a tone of angry astonishment.
&#8220;Impossible!&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Yes; Mitli puts ideas into Berthe&#8217;s head, ideas
about money, dress, and young men, and she makes
the girl her tool, and has, Jesus Maria! corrupted her
mind.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;My child corrupt anyone! How dared she say
such things!&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;At least she makes trouble,&mdash;and now she no
longer is received&mdash;no, not these two months.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Oh, surely you must be mistaken,&#8221; but the remonstrance
was half-hearted; &#8220;she was there last
week.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;No doubt Mitli pretends she still goes to Les Lilacs&mdash;it
has its conveniences.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;But if not at the Baers,&mdash;<i>where</i> is she?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Ah,&#8221; putting down the iron, and lifting her hard
brown hands, &#8220;it is not for me to say; but this I
know; she deceives us. Many an hour when the girl is
supposed to be at classes, or with her school mates,
Mitli is elsewhere. She has been given too much love,
and liberty, and too much trust.&#8221;</p>

<p>And with this pronouncement, Frau Hurter turned
to the stove to fetch another iron.</p>

<p>Cara&#8217;s mother ascended to her room, filled with
anxiety and far-reaching fears. As she stood at the
open window, looking out on the lake and the stars,<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_333"></a>[333]</span>
inhaling air honey-sweet, with the breath of flowers,&mdash;a
singular desolation, a sense of homelessness, and
loneliness, came upon her. Something had overtaken
her, from which there was no escape; something had
died in her heart&mdash;the belief in Cara&#8217;s truth, and innocence.
She opened the communicating door very
gently, and peeped into the next room. Cara was asleep,
with a candle guttering beside the bed. An open book
lay on the floor. Letty picked it up and glanced at the
title. <i>Bel Ami</i>, Guy de Maupassant. Then she blew
out the light, returned to her own room, undressed,
and went to bed, where she lay awake for hours;
blaming herself for blunders and failures, making good
resolutions, now and then bursting into stifled sobs, till
the sparrows in the pear tree began to twitter, and an
exquisite new day came stealing down the mountains.
Now that she had an assured income of two hundred
a year, Letty had ceased to work incessantly for daily
bread, and had spare time, to spend with her girl, to
share her walks, and excursions, and amusements; but
her proffered companionship appeared to be unwelcome.
When she suggested a row on the lake, a tea
picnic, a steamer trip, she was generally assured that
such outings were impossible, Cara&#8217;s engagements were
so numerous; she was playing tennis with the Maas
girls, or spending the day at Engelberg with her
drawing-mistress, or going to the swimming baths with
their friends of the Weggisgasse, and much-sought-for
Mitli seemed to have no desire and no leisure, for the
society of her mother.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_334"></a>[334]</span>During the last fortnight, a sudden and strange
change had come over the girl; looking back, Letty
dated it from the day of the f&ecirc;te, or a little later. She
had become silent, moody, and almost morose&mdash;as if
she cherished a mortal grievance and was offended
with everyone; and sometimes when she looked up
her mother found Cara&#8217;s eyes fixed upon her with a
sullen, almost hostile expression. What did it mean?
Cara no longer cared to visit the Paradis, to tea or
<i>d&eacute;jeuner</i>&mdash;once hailed as a welcome treat. She shut
herself up in her room, writing letters, and every
morning walked down to Mitzau to the post office,&mdash;instead
of awaiting the leisurely arrival of the facteur.</p>

<p>She was restless, irritable, strange; undoubtedly
her condition had something to do with her correspondence,
and her mother, acting upon her newly formed
resolutions, made bold enquiries.</p>

<p>One afternoon as they were walking down the hill
together, she screwed up her courage and said:</p>

<p>&#8220;Who is it you are writing to so constantly, Cara?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;No one in particular,&#8221; answered the girl, with a
toss of her head.</p>

<p>&#8220;But what a waste of time and energy!&#8221; Again
she braced herself, determined to exercise an authority
too long relaxed.</p>

<p>&#8220;I think, dear, that I ought to know who is your
correspondent.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Why, Mum,&#8221; and Cara came to a standstill, &#8220;this
is something <i>quite</i> new! You&#8217;ve never asked such a
thing before.&#8221;</p>



<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_335"></a>[335]</span>&#8220;But I believe I should have done so, Cara. Better
late than never. I&#8217;m afraid, dear child, that I have
been hitherto too slack, too busy with my work, to
take a proper interest in your affairs.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;This is too funny!&#8221; cried Cara angrily; &#8220;that old
Hesketh spy, has put you up to this.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;No&mdash;and that is no way to speak of her,&#8221; reproved
Letty with surprising spirit; &#8220;and now I must insist
on knowing who it is, that you have been writing to
to-day?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Oh, then, since you <i>insist</i>,&#8221; said Cara, putting her
hand in the pocket of her coat, &#8220;here is my correspondence,&#8221;
and she exhibited a letter addressed to, &#8216;Peter
Robinson, Regent Street, London, W.&#8217;</p>

<p>&#8220;A man certainly, but a stranger to me.&#8221;</p>

<p>(There was another letter remaining in her pocket,
and this was inscribed to, &#8216;Hugo Blagdon, Esq.,
Sharsley Court, Yorks.&#8217;)</p>

<p>Letty, as she received Peter Robinson&#8217;s letter, felt
a little abashed. Could all the other suspicions have
the same ending? Oh, could they?&mdash;if so what a
heavy load would be lifted from her mind!</p>

<p>&#8220;Yes, I see,&#8221; she assented, &#8220;you are sending for
patterns; but surely you are not continually writing
to shops?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Why not? <i>You</i> know best, why I have no English
correspondence. The July sales are on, and one gets
things for half of nothing, trimmings, stockings, gloves,
scarves. Tomlin gave me the tip.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Oh, did she?&#8221; murmured Letty, not a little<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_336"></a>[336]</span>
daunted by Cara&#8217;s manner; then she resumed with an
effort, &#8220;Cara, my dear, why will you not be more
open with me, and confide in me, and tell me things?
No one in the world, takes as much interest in you, or
is as anxious for your happiness, as <i>I</i> am.&#8221;</p>

<p>The girl glanced slyly at the pretty, incredibly young-looking
woman who was her mother; with her clear
complexion, abundant hair, and slim figure, she might
almost be a contemporary of her own!</p>

<p>&#8220;What sort of things?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Just the sort of things you tell your girl friends.&#8221;
Cara broke out into an irrepressible shout of laughter,&mdash;laughter,
in which there sounded a note of mockery or
derision,&mdash;and Letty, with a heightened colour, added:</p>

<p>&#8220;Frau Hurter has informed me, that you no longer
go to the Baers&mdash;is this the case?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Yes, I&#8217;ve had a terrific row with Berthe and her
mother&mdash;horrible, bourgeois brutes!&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;But you used to be so fond of Berthe&mdash;you&#8217;ve
known one another nearly all your lives.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I never knew her, or found her out, until lately.
I&#8217;ll tell you all about it another time. Here is the
Paradis. I&#8217;m not going in. Give my <i>hate</i> to Mrs.
Hesketh. Oh, well, darling Mum, don&#8217;t look so
shocked,&#8221; patting her lightly on the arm; &#8220;you know,
I never mean the quarter of what I say, and you also
know, that she can&#8217;t endure the sight of me!&#8221; Then
Miss Glyn embraced her mother, and turned quickly
about to walk to Mitzau, and post her letter.</p>

<p>Mrs. Hesketh, who was awaiting her friend in the<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_337"></a>[337]</span>
lounge, looked unusually solemn as she asked, &#8220;What
have you done with the girl?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;She has gone to the post. I think, dear Cousin
Maude, she has a sort of instinct that you don&#8217;t care
for her.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Let us have tea at once,&#8221; said her friend, brusquely
ignoring the question; &#8220;afterwards, we will go up to
my room and hold a meeting.&#8221;</p>

<p>As the tea proceeded, Letty was conscious that there
was thunder in the atmosphere; the symptoms were
as clear as when a storm was collecting in the neighbouring
mountains, and rugged old Pilatus arrayed
himself as a preliminary, in a series of scarf-like clouds.
Although Mrs. Hesketh talked spasmodically of home
news, and exchanged civil greetings with acquaintances,
her manner was abstracted. Undoubtedly some
subject lay heavily on her mind, and Letty hurried over
her tea, declining a second cup, and said:</p>

<p>&#8220;Do let us go upstairs, I cannot bear suspense&mdash;anything
is better than <i>that</i>.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;So, then, you guess?&#8221; said her friend, leading the
way to the sitting-room, and drawing forward two
chairs on her balcony.</p>

<p>&#8220;I cannot guess what you may have to say,&mdash;only
that I&#8217;m sure it is something to do with the child.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;It has. Hitherto, excepting that night at the f&ecirc;te&mdash;and
we might have been mistaken&mdash;we have had
nothing to support suspicion, beyond Frau Hurter&#8217;s
natural animosity towards a girl who has bewitched
her son.&#8221;</p>



<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_338"></a>[338]</span>&#8220;Yes,&#8221; agreed Letty breathlessly.</p>

<p>&#8220;And now, I have got hold of facts.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;How? Facts!&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;By the means of unintentional eavesdropping in
this very verandah.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Eavesdropping?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Yes, you know how sounds ascend. I was
sitting up here last night alone, enjoying the
glorious view, and moonlight&mdash;vaguely aware that
some men were talking and smoking just below,
and one of them who had a loud, resonant voice,
was describing someone who was splendid sport.
When he said &#8216;a flapper of seventeen,&#8217; I pricked
up my ears at once.</p>

<p>&#8220;&#8216;Knows her way about,&#8217; he went on, &#8216;uncommonly
handsome&mdash;and up to all sorts of games.&#8217;</p>

<p>&#8220;Letty, I leant nearer, and listened shamelessly,
and another voice asked:</p>

<p>&#8220;&#8216;Where does she hang out?&#8217;</p>

<p>&#8220;&#8216;At a farm up the hill here, a place called Les
Plans.&#8217;</p>

<p>&#8220;&#8216;Oh,&#8217; said the other, &#8216;a native?&#8217;</p>

<p>&#8220;&#8216;No&mdash;English&mdash;and by way of being a lady. She
has lived here with her mother since she was a kid;
the mother is a damned pretty woman&mdash;&mdash;&#8217;</p>

<p>&#8220;I am repeating what I heard verbatim&mdash;</p>

<p>&#8220;&#8216;&mdash;but a fool. She lets the girl go marauding all
over the place alone. Ahem! Well, not exactly <i>alone</i>&mdash;because
she trusts her absolutely!&#8217;</p>

<p>&#8220;At this they all roared.&#8221; Here Mrs. Hesketh<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_339"></a>[339]</span>
paused. Letty was now sobbing audibly, her face
buried in her hands.</p>

<p>&#8220;Then a man asked, &#8216;How did you find her?&#8217;&#8221;
pursued Mrs. Hesketh.</p>

<p>&#8220;&#8216;Angus McKenzie gave me the tip; he was here
last year&mdash;met her on the boat, and they got tremendously
chummy. He used to take her about, and give
her treats, when she was supposed to be having lessons
in Lucerne&mdash;ha! ha! But, mind you, she knows how
to take rattling good care of herself. She was capital
company, with a lot of &#8220;go,&#8221; and wonderfully
advanced ideas for her age&mdash;especially with regard
to spending money!&#8217;&#8221;</p>

<p>Here Mrs. Hesketh paused, and looked at her companion,
who was still sobbing hysterically.</p>

<p>&#8220;Letty, are you listening to me? Do please pull
yourself together!&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I am, of course, listening,&#8221; she gasped. &#8220;I am&mdash;oh,
it is all my fault. Oh, Cousin Maude, do not blame
the child! I&#8217;ve been a bad mother after all! I
allowed her to slip out of my hands, and gave her her
own way, and was too, too indulgent; but I myself
was so strictly brought up, and had so little love, and
sympathy, and freedom, I was resolved that Cara
should <i>never</i> suffer in the same way.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Letty, be quiet!&#8221; interposed her friend angrily.
&#8220;I won&#8217;t sit here, and listen to you abusing yourself.
You have been too self-sacrificing, and, I&#8217;m afraid,
weak. But how could you oppose your will to Cara&#8217;s?
Hers is of iron,&mdash;and you know your own failing. You<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_340"></a>[340]</span>
sent her to excellent schools, you believed she had
good companions; you could not conduct her to and
from school, or be always with her like a keeper&mdash;you
had to work hard, to maintain yourself and her,
and, when possible, you shared her pleasures and
made yourself her companion&mdash;you could have done
no more.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;And I could not well do less,&#8221; said Letty as she
dried her eyes. &#8220;Was that all the men said?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;No. It seems that Cara used to climb out of her
bedroom window, and descend by the pear tree into
the garden, and sit in the summer-house, smoking
cigarettes with visitors from the Paradis; and for this
reason, the old watch-dog was put out of the way.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Oh, poor, poor Karo! I was sure he had been
poisoned!&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;And it appears, that when you supposed Cara to
be spending the day with Berthe, she was really lunching
and carousing with one or other of these festive
strangers! This accounts, for her craze for pretty
restaurant frocks, smart beflowered hats, and all the
reckless bills. I gathered that she did not accept
presents, beyond chocolates, flowers, entertainments,
and motor rides. Sometimes she motored home after
the last boat had gone, and had what they called uncommonly
narrow shaves of being spotted! Now,
Letty, you positively <i>must</i> assume another attitude, and
be firm, and absolute. There would be no use in my
talking to Cara&mdash;she abhors me. We will arrange to go
to England as soon as possible, and place the young<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_341"></a>[341]</span>
woman in a school; this will no doubt have a sobering
effect and be a change that will do her good. I know
of a capital finishing establishment in Brighton, and
with your leave or without, I&#8217;ll write to-morrow.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Yes, as you like; but I feel bewildered, dazed&mdash;&mdash;&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;You had better have an interview with Cara to-night,
and tell her you know all, and that in future you
will never trust her out of your sight. She shall not
stir without you, or me, or Tomlin at her heels, and in
ten days we start for England. Settle up with Frau
Hurter, and leave all other arrangements to me. My
poor Letty, I am sorry for you, but I will stand by
you shoulder to shoulder, and see you through this
crisis.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;But it&#8217;s so easy for us to wonder, and blame, and
plan. When Cara comes on the scene, somehow I am
always put in the wrong and defeated.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;You cannot possibly be defeated on this occasion,&#8221;
declared her friend, with confidence. &#8220;All the right
and might is on your side: the right of a good and
too unselfish mother, and the might of the purse.
Cara has no money.&#8221;</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>&#8220;Cara,&#8221; said her mother, coming into her room
that evening, &#8220;I wish to speak to you very
seriously.&#8221;</p>

<p>Cara, who was in her petticoats, and in the act of
unpinning her abundant hair, turned about sharply
and said:</p>

<p>&#8220;Oh, yes, let&#8217;s have it out, then! I&#8217;ve felt there<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_342"></a>[342]</span>
was something in the air. What has Frau Hurter been
telling you <i>now</i>? She went for me this morning like
any old fish-fag, and said I had ruined Fritz, and
broken his heart, and he was no good for anything!&#8221;
And she tossed back a mane of hair, and glared a
challenge.</p>

<p>&#8220;It is not Fritz, Cara. It is about the strangers&mdash;the
Englishmen, whom you meet clandestinely and go
about with, motoring and amusing yourself, when all
the time I&#8217;ve been trusting you, and thinking you were
taking lessons in Lucerne.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Oh!&#8221; dropping her arms, &#8220;so it has leaked out
at last! Well, it had to some day. I&#8217;ve had a ripping
time, and I&#8217;m not sorry.&#8221; And this handsome young
woman, with her bare arms and neck, and flowing
hair, faced her accuser unabashed, and unrepentant,
assuring herself, she had no reason to be afraid; she
was always able to cow, and browbeat the Mum.</p>

<p>&#8220;Oh, Cara, Cara! How <i>could</i> you?&#8221; murmured
her parent, with uplifted hands.</p>

<p>&#8220;Well, I believe most people know I&#8217;ve friends&mdash;men
friends. Fritz was crazy, when he saw me speaking
to Captain Seymour; but think of the awful,
awful life I lead here, and other English girls have
such good times! I&#8217;ve done no harm whatever&mdash;I&#8217;ve
only amused myself. And why not?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Getting out of your bedroom window at night,
and sitting in the garden with strange men from the
Paradis!&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Now, who can have told you that?&#8221; she asked<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_343"></a>[343]</span>
sharply. &#8220;<i>Jost?</i> though for ten francs he swore he&#8217;d
hold his tongue; treacherous old devil!&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Never mind who told&mdash;I know everything.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Do you, Mum? I doubt it. I&#8217;ve had lots of
affairs since I was fifteen,&#8221; and she eyed her mother
with amusement. &#8220;Yes, it&#8217;s in my blood. You asked
me to tell you things&mdash;and I <i>will</i>.&#8221;</p>

<p>Now that the ice was broken, Cara felt tempted to
shock her mother; she would enjoy the sensation.</p>

<p>&#8220;Since you were fifteen?&#8221; repeated Letty in an
incredulous whisper.</p>

<p>Cara nodded, with smiling complacence.</p>

<p>&#8220;Yes, first, there was the violinist, an Italian, who
said he was a Count. He gave me chocolates and
flowers,&mdash;till I spotted him in the orchestra; but even
then I was gone on Pablo. After Pablo, the nice German
boy from Heidelberg; he wrote me verses, and gave
me a ring. There was also Anton Baer, who took me
up Pilatus when you thought I was in bed at the
Baers, with a sprained ankle; and Major McKenzie,
who spoke to me on the boat; and Captain Seymour&mdash;and
always, always Fritz.&#8221;</p>

<p>As Letty stood pale and rigid, as if turned to stone,
Cara concluded:</p>

<p>&#8220;After all, I&#8217;ve done no harm; one is young but
once!&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;No harm, Cara? I think you have broken my
heart! A girl of seventeen making herself notorious.
Do you know that you are the laughing-stock of
men at the Paradis; who discuss you, and hold<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_344"></a>[344]</span>
you very cheap?&mdash;no harm in losing your good
name!&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;As to broken hearts,&#8221; retorted Cara, who was now
plaiting her hair vigorously, &#8220;I don&#8217;t believe in them;
and I&#8217;ve heard enough of that rubbish from Fritz to
last a lifetime.&#8221; The term &#8216;laughing-stock&#8217; had
stirred her keenly, and she went on, her temper at
white heat: &#8220;As for my good name, I can take care
of that; and, my darling Mum,&#8221; and she drew herself
up, and tossed back a plait, &#8220;<i>you</i> are the last
person to talk of &#8216;a good name.&#8217;&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;What do you mean, Cara?&#8221; Letty asked faintly.</p>

<p>&#8220;I mean,&#8221; speaking with deliberate emphasis, &#8220;that
I <i>know</i>.&#8221;</p>

<p>Her mother took two steps backwards, staggered
blindly, and sat down on the side of the bed,&mdash;her
face as colourless as the counterpane.</p>

<p>&#8220;Yes, I must say, I think you should not have kept
it from me, Mum. Of course, I don&#8217;t think any the
worse of you, dear.&#8221; She would have taken her
mother&#8217;s hand, but Letty pushed her from her, with
impatience, and her trembling lips put the question:</p>

<p>&#8220;Who told you?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Miss Plassy&mdash;she said I <i>ought</i> to know.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Yes, go on,&#8221; urged her mother in a stifled voice;
&#8220;be quick and tell me.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;She told me that my name is Blagdon. My father
is enormously rich, and that you ran away with an
officer when I was a kid, and were divorced, and a year
later, you came and stole me from my nurse, and<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_345"></a>[345]</span>
brought me off here. That&#8217;s the story!&mdash;it sounds
crude, but she swore it was true and in all the papers.
I can get over the divorce all right,&#8221; continued Cara,
with an air of superb generosity, &#8220;but really and
truly, Mum, I cannot forgive you for kidnapping me,
and bringing me off abroad, to lead this wretched,
poverty-stricken life.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Cara,&#8221; cried her mother, rising to her feet, and
speaking with unexpected violence, &#8220;you have heard
a garbled tale&mdash;only one side. Now you shall hear
mine,&#8221; and standing erect, confronting her daughter,
she poured forth the story of her wrongs, her misery,
and her married life.</p>

<p>Her eloquence&mdash;the eloquence of a bursting heart&mdash;was
such, that even Cara for a moment felt moved,
ashamed, yes, and repentant. So overwhelming was
the effect of her mother&#8217;s picture of a blighted youth, a
life of solitude, and her passionate attachment to herself,
that Cara for once betrayed into real personal
feeling, fell into her mother&#8217;s arms, overcome by a
storm of unparalleled emotion.</p>

<p>At last, with sobs and caresses from Letty, murmurs
of penitence and adoration from Cara, mother and
daughter, exhausted by this violent strain, separated
at last, to seek what rest they might.</p>

<p>For hours Cara lay watching the window with hard
restless eyes, turning over her mother&#8217;s story in her
mind, and weighing it remorselessly. As time passed,
her feelings had subsided; it was one thing to be
touched by a beautiful face, an impassioned pleading,<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_346"></a>[346]</span>
and unfortunate history; it was another, in the dim,
pale dawn, to recall facts&mdash;remorseless facts. The fact of
the divorce&mdash;the fact that her mother had stolen her&mdash;the
fact that she was an heiress&mdash;the fact that she,
Cara, with all her beauty, good birth, and cravings, was
poor and insignificant, and living on a few francs a
week at a detestable old Swiss farm. Of course, she
was fond of the Mum; certainly she was fond of her;
and she had had a horrid life,&mdash;but probably she had
not known how to manage people. Probably?&mdash;why,
of course not&mdash;she never could manage anyone! She,
Cara, had her own life to lead, and must strike out for
herself. Meanwhile she resolved to be very kind and
good to the Mum,&mdash;and to keep no more trysts. What
brutes of men to talk! For the future, she resolved to
remain under her mother&#8217;s wing; it would be too
ridiculous for a great heiress to make herself cheap!</p>

<p>Letty as she lay also watching her window, never
slept at all; her thoughts were too active. She recalled
Cara&#8217;s manner, her callous admissions, her bombshell,
and subsequently her surprising breakdown. This, she
knew from experience, to be but a temporary affair&mdash;there
had been former scenes and reconciliations, from
which Cara had, as on the present occasion, emerged
victorious!</p>
<hr class="chap x-ebookmaker-drop" />

<div class="chapter">
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_347"></a>[347]</span>

<h2 class="nobreak">CHAPTER XXXIII</h2>
</div>


<p class="drop-cap">&#8220;SO she has known for a whole fortnight and kept
it to herself,&#8221; said Mrs. Hesketh with luminous
eyes. &#8220;I had no idea that Cara was capable of such
amazing self-control. This accounts for her inexplicable
silence, sullenness, and studied insolence to <i>me</i>.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Of course, the information was startling,&#8221; pleaded
Letty. &#8220;Her whole little world turned upside down;
the child has taken the news amazingly well, and is so
sweet and affectionate. This morning she asked me
to tell you that she is very sorry and ashamed of her
rudeness to you, and intends to turn over a new leaf.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I am not sure that I have much faith in these
new leaves,&#8221; rejoined Mrs. Hesketh ungraciously;
&#8220;but I am prepared to accept the olive branch. You
say the girl is sitting at home sewing, whilst you are
abroad? You appear to have changed places.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Only for once. It was so important that I should
see you. Now Cara has been enlightened, perhaps it
is for the best&mdash;it <i>had</i> to come some day.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;And malicious Miss Plassy has spared no details&mdash;you
have no <i>further</i> disclosures to fear. Bring Cara to
dinner to-night, I should like to have a talk with her,
and we will smoke the pipe of peace.&#8221;</p>

<p>For the next ten days all went smoothly. Cara no<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_348"></a>[348]</span>
longer yearned for solitary excursions into Lucerne; on
the contrary, she appeared to be glad of her mother&#8217;s
companionship, and had figuratively attached herself
to her apron string!</p>

<p>Meanwhile, arrangements for a move were in progress.
Mrs. Hesketh had written home, announcing
the arrival of two friends, ordering alterations in the
house, and entering into treaty for a new motor.</p>

<p>A whole month had passed, and there had been no
reply to Cara&#8217;s filial appeal&mdash;an appeal which had cost
hours of thought, and been written and rewritten again
and again. Her heart and her hopes sank; this condition
was salutary, the girl&mdash;like all bullies&mdash;was
absurdly elated by success, whilst failure bowed her to
the earth. In despair of her father&#8217;s favour and rescue,
she now turned to her mother, whom she contemplated
by the light of her illuminating story. She dwelt on
that passionately pleading figure, that ringing voice,
those piteous eyes, and appealing hands; and could not
but believe that every word she uttered was <i>true</i>. Her
father&#8217;s silence was ample proof of his unnatural
character; he must be a brute! And she herself had
witnessed one of the principal scenes in her mother&#8217;s
history. That afternoon on the <i>Schiller</i>, when they
had met the handsome English officer, who implored
her mother to agree to something, and her mother had
not consented; now she learnt that he had asked her
to marry him, and leave her, Cara, at school&mdash;and the
Mum had refused. She recalled his urgent air, and her
mother&#8217;s tears. It was evident that she cared for him&mdash;and<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_349"></a>[349]</span>
no wonder! Had she been in her mother&#8217;s place,
his offer would have been accepted&mdash;<i>bien sur!</i> And the
Mum was so pretty&mdash;no matter how shabby or simple
her clothes, she always looked well-born&mdash;a lady to
the tips of her fingers. Everything she accomplished
was so neat, so finished: her room and belongings so
orderly; such a contrast to her own apartment,
which was always untidy; she never could find
anything, and flung away hats, stepped out of skirts,
kicked off shoes, and left the Mum to clear up, and put
her things straight. She seemed at last to realise, what
her mother stood for in her life, and became thoughtful,
helpful, and affectionate. She ran errands, carried
parcels, and was altogether another and softer Cara.
These were indeed halcyon days for Letty! She brought
her good news to the bedside of her friend, who was
confined to her room with a serious bronchial attack.</p>

<p>&#8220;The child is so changed,&#8221; she said, &#8220;so warm-hearted,
loving, and confidential. She has confessed
<i>everything</i> to me; all about those odious men, and how
they taught her to smoke, and supplied her with
cigarettes and chocolates, and took her trips in motor-boats.
She declares she only went with them for the
fun of the thing, the thrilling excitement of adventure,
and possible discovery! She will never deceive me
again as long as she lives&mdash;we are to have <i>no</i> secrets
from one another.&#8221;</p>

<p>Here Mrs. Hesketh murmured something inarticulate
into the down quilt, and her visitor continued:</p>

<p>&#8220;And she is so interested in Sharsley, and asks me<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_350"></a>[350]</span>
to tell her all about the place, and about Thornby and
Oldcourt. Oh, Cousin Maude,&#8221; and she sank on her
knees by the bed, and took her hand in hers, &#8220;I am so
happy at last! I am well repaid for my strivings.
Cara and I are now all in all to one another.&#8221;</p>

<p>During this interview, Cara had been waiting for her
mother in the lounge&mdash;she was now full of these touching
little attentions. As she waited one of her English
acquaintances happened to enter, paused, and bowed
with ironical ceremony. Then he approached, and
said in a jocular key:</p>

<p>&#8220;Hullo, Goldylocks! what are you doing here?
Why so proud?&#8221;</p>

<p>Goldylocks raised her eyes, stared at him fiercely,
and resumed her study of a picture paper; and after a
momentary hesitation, Captain Seymour felt compelled
to pass on. Cara had done with these odious free-and-easy
men, who joked with her, flattered her, and
then talked her over, and laughed at her behind her
back. That thought acted as a lash, and kept Miss
Blagdon&#8217;s exuberant impulses in check.</p>

<p>Presently her mother reappeared, and as they
climbed the hill together, arm in arm, she said:</p>

<p>&#8220;Cousin Maude is so much better, the doctor thinks
she may move in ten days, and we will travel with her.
You know the school idea has been abandoned, and
you can easily keep up your music, and French with
me. I do hope you won&#8217;t find Thornby too dull;
there is no one in the village now, except the Dentons.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;And your aunt&mdash;the hunting lady?&#8221;</p>



<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_351"></a>[351]</span>&#8220;No; she lives in Brighton, I am thankful to
say, but the poor old Holt is closed. Cara,&#8221; and her
mother halted on the little plateau, &#8220;Mrs. Hesketh has
been frightening me. She asks, if your father claimed
you, what would you do?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Why <i>you</i> know, Mummy,&#8221; throwing her arm
round her waist, &#8220;I&#8217;ll never, never leave you!&#8221; and
she covered her face with kisses.</p>

<p>&#8220;If you had been a boy, darling, of course I&#8217;d never,
never have dared to carry you off; but I wanted you
so badly, and he did not; you were left alone with
your nurse in a corner of that great big house, your
father ignored you; he dislikes girls&mdash;even grown-up
girls.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Yet he married a girl, Mummy. Why you were
only my age&mdash;seventeen!&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Yes, dear, but your father soon got tired of me.
At seventeen, I was years younger than you are; I
was painfully timid, silly, and undecided&mdash;and&mdash;&mdash;&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;You are undecided still; but there is no one in
all the whole world, as clever and good, as my own
beautiful Mum,&#8221; and Cara bent her fair head, and
kissed her mother on the lips.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>Hugo Blagdon was now a stout, irascible, red-faced
man of fifty-seven, who for the sake of his health was
every year compelled to take &#8216;a cure&#8217; at Carlsbad,
and here Cara&#8217;s letters followed, and found him. As
he casually opened number one, then glanced at<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_352"></a>[352]</span>
the signature, his complexion changed from red to
purple.</p>

<p>&#8220;What the devil does this mean?&#8221; he muttered.</p>

<p>He was soon in possession of full information. In
Cara&#8217;s fine bold hand, she assured him that only within
the last twenty-four hours she had learnt her own and
her mother&#8217;s story, and that her father was still living.
She went on to say, that she was weary of exile, had a
craving to see her native land, and <i>him</i>; described herself
as tall and fair, very fond of outdoor sports, and
games, and hoped that he would soon write to her,
send for her, and allow her to know him, and remained
his affectionate daughter, Caroline Blagdon. &#8216;P.S.&mdash;Please
address Miss Glyn, Poste Restante, Mitzau. I
am sending you my photograph.&#8217;</p>

<p>&#8220;By George!&#8221; he exclaimed when he came to the
end of her epistle, &#8220;a grown-up daughter, and she
writes with spirit; no milk and water about <i>her</i>!&#8221;
Yes, and here was her photograph. It was many years
since he had experienced such a thrill of expectation,
as when he cut the string, and uncovered a cabinet-sized
photograph which displayed a handsome girl, with a
resolute jaw, broad shoulders, and large hands. It
must be confessed, that the likeness did not do justice
to the sitter&#8217;s best points&mdash;her hair, complexion, and
teeth.</p>

<p>&#8220;Not bad-looking,&#8221; was her father&#8217;s verdict. After
gazing at it for a long time, studying the dress and
details, he put both letter and photo into his breast
coat pocket, and went off to his bath.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_353"></a>[353]</span>No need to do anything in a hurry; letter-writing
was the mischief, and dangerous. He would take
his time,&mdash;and he did. Several anxious epistles from
Les Plans remained unnoticed, and hence his daughter&#8217;s
despair. It was evident that there was nothing before
her, but the prospect of a dull life in an English village,
and she decided to make the best of circumstances.</p>

<p>Her father, meanwhile, had resolved to motor to
Lucerne for his &#8216;after cure,&#8217; but not commit himself
in any way. He would first look round cautiously, and
see how the land lay.</p>

<p>Hugo Blagdon in his magnificent car arrived early
in September, and put up at the National. After an
excellent lunch&mdash;concluded with coffee and liqueur&mdash;he
strolled forth on the Quai, and stared frowningly on the
lovely scene; the mountains and hills of all shades of
blue, the lake gay with traffic; finally he went into
the Casino gardens and bestowed his heavy form upon
a seat. The band was playing, and the place was
crowded. He debated with himself the question of a
bock&mdash;yes or no&mdash;the verdict was &#8216;no&#8217;: he had
recently lost ten pounds in weight and must keep himself
down. Bye and by, among the crowd, he was
glad to recognise a racing acquaintance, and signalled
to him to join him at his little table.</p>

<p>As they sat, discussing jockeys, weights, and other
matters, the man said:</p>

<p>&#8220;This is a great season, I have never seen the place
so full, nor so many pretty frocks, and faces. Hullo&mdash;look
there!&#8221;</p>



<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_354"></a>[354]</span>Two ladies were crossing the gardens, both tall and
both wearing summer hats, and white gowns; their air
and good looks distinguished them from the crowd.</p>

<p>For a moment Blagdon stared with stolid incredulity,
then he hastily put down his cigar, for he had recognised
Letty! A beautiful, self-possessed Letty, with an air
of fragile grace, who, although laden with several
parcels, carried herself like a queen; the girl, of
bigger build, with clouds of hair and marvellous
colouring, was his correspondent Cara,&mdash;she looked
every day of twenty!</p>

<p>He was actually gazing at his own wife and daughter&mdash;so
were others; the pair had been accosted by
friends, and stopped to talk, and this afforded the
spectators an opportunity to admire.</p>

<p>&#8220;By Jove, Englishwomen are hard to beat! I bet
those two are English,&#8221; said his companion. &#8220;The
elder is the best looking&mdash;a handsome woman. The
young one seems full of go, and what teeth and
colouring! But she hasn&#8217;t her sister&#8217;s figure.&#8221;</p>

<p>Here indeed was an entirely different individual to the
cowering Letty of fourteen years previously, and how
well she had worn! Now she would shine in any company&mdash;his
wife&mdash;yes, and his daughter. She, too, was
ripping: so sure of herself; he watched her gay gestures
and broad smiles, her well-cut frock, and neat
figure&mdash;rather on the heavy side. What a complexion!
By George, she&#8217;d make &#8217;em all sit up! Yes, he decided
to claim her&mdash;a handsome wife was one thing: a handsome
daughter, reflected still more credit on a fellow.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_355"></a>[355]</span>Cara was a Blagdon&mdash;his own flesh and blood, and
he was sick of his old associates.</p>

<p>&#8220;I say, Blagdon, you are not very gay; the after
cure depressing? Eh?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;No, I&#8217;m all right,&#8221; with a shake of his great shoulders.
&#8220;I&#8217;m just thinking of a good thing I&#8217;ve come in
for.&#8221;</p>

<p>Repton stared. Was old Blag off his chump? had
he been drinking?</p>

<p>&#8220;Oh, it&#8217;s only a filly of mine, a rare one, that
will show &#8217;em all the way,&#8221; and he chuckled to
himself.</p>

<p>&#8220;Ah, then, I&#8217;ll look to you for a tip!&#8221;</p>

<p>Blagdon noted the break-up of the party, which concluded
with cordial hand-shaking, and adieux. Subsequently
mother and daughter walked away talking
together eagerly&mdash;evidently the best of pals. He rose instantly,
followed, and kept them in view. In the Swan
Platz, opposite Cook&#8217;s, the two separated; Letty to cross
the bridge, the girl to enter the Arcade: here he saw
her disappear into a shop, and waited. As he waited,
he meditated; he was full of impatience to claim this
creditable daughter; in face her mother, in manner and
figure a Blagdon. What&mdash;cold thought&mdash;would Connie
say?&mdash;Con, more or less lived with, as well as on him.
She had the Blagdon will, tongue, and temper. Well,
from the girl&#8217;s air and off-hand manner, he expected she
could hold her own; and by George, he had done a
lot for Con, from first to last, and paid her debts over
and over. It was time he did something for his only<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_356"></a>[356]</span>
daughter,&mdash;who had not cost him a farthing since she
cut her first teeth. As he conferred with himself, the
girl came briskly out of the shop. He had been
pretending to be looking into the window, and at
once accosted her.</p>

<p>&#8220;I say,&#8221; he began, staring hard into her face,
&#8220;aren&#8217;t you&mdash;er&mdash;Caroline&mdash;Blagdon?&#8221;</p>

<p>She stood stock still, and surveyed him with startled
eyes, and a heightened colour.</p>

<p>Could this heavy, elderly man, with a large, reddish
face, be her father? Why Kaspar at the landing-stage
looked more distinguished. Of course his clothes and
voice were all right&mdash;but&mdash;&mdash;</p>

<p>She nodded curtly.</p>

<p>&#8220;I got your letters,&#8221; he resumed, &#8220;and as I was in
Germany motoring, I thought I&#8217;d come on here and
look you up. Seeing is believing. I&#8217;m your father, you
know.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Yes&mdash;are you?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I say, let&#8217;s walk about a bit, where we can talk.
Where&#8217;s your mother? I bar meeting her.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;She has gone across the bridge to say good-bye to
some friends; we are leaving next week. She won&#8217;t
be back for an hour. I&#8217;m to meet her at the five
o&#8217;clock boat.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Oh, so then we have a clear hour! Come along to
the National.&#8221;</p>

<p>For a perceptible pause Cara&#8217;s hesitation was obvious:
she neither spoke nor stirred&mdash;and her reluctance
enormously enhanced her value in her father&#8217;s eyes.&mdash;However,<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_357"></a>[357]</span>
as she said to herself, she might as well
hear, what he had to propose&mdash;no harm&mdash;in that!</p>

<p>As they strolled together past the shops, Blagdon
was gratified to note how many eyes were bent on his
companion. This was the sort of girl that appealed to
him; she was well turned out, too, and walked as if
the whole earth belonged to her.</p>

<p>&#8220;Lived here always?&#8221; he asked abruptly.</p>

<p>&#8220;Yes, since I was four. Now I&#8217;m seventeen.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;And look every day of twenty or more,&#8221; he exclaimed
with habitual brusquerie.</p>

<p>&#8220;Do I? And you,&#8221; considering him with cold, undaunted
eyes, &#8220;I suppose are sixty&mdash;or more?&#8221;</p>

<p>Blagdon&#8217;s face assumed a deeper hue. His neck
appeared to swell, an apoplectic seizure seemed imminent;
he was not accustomed to be thus bearded.</p>

<p>However, for once, with a violent effort, he restrained
himself, and answered:</p>

<p>&#8220;A fellow&#8217;s the age he feels&mdash;a woman the age she
looks.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;That&#8217;s rubbish!&#8221; declared his bold companion,
&#8220;and was certainly invented by a <i>man</i>!&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I say, young lady, you seem to have a fairly sharp
tongue!&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;A sharp tongue and a sweet temper,&#8221; she retorted.</p>

<p>It was evident to her electrified and humbled parent,
that the girl did not care a brass farthing whether he
reinstated her or not! The saucy young woman was
entirely independent, and made no secret of her attitude.
The chances were, that if she had been appealing,<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_358"></a>[358]</span>
eager, and slavish, he would not have been so anxious
to claim her&mdash;but Cara had taken her father&#8217;s measure,
with a very sure eye.</p>

<p>&#8220;Well, here we are,&#8221; he continued, leading the way
up the steps; &#8220;come into the lounge, and let&#8217;s get to
know one another. I saw you and your mother
together just now&mdash;you seem to be tremendous
pals.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;So we are,&#8221; said Cara, as she threw herself carelessly
into a comfortable chair. &#8220;My mother has been
awfully good to me.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Eh? Well, at any rate, she ran away with you,
and now,&#8221; coming and standing directly before her,
&#8220;what do you say to giving <i>me</i> a turn?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;What do you call a turn?&#8221; she enquired, looking
back into his eyes, with a true family stare; the girl
had a spice of the devil in her, that was certain.</p>

<p>&#8220;You will live with me in Hill Street,&#8221; he announced
pompously; and seeing that this fact made no impression,
&#8220;have a motor, and a maid.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Yes?&#8221; The &#8216;yes&#8217; was cool and indifferent.</p>

<p>&#8220;As many frocks and gewgaws as you want, and
theatres and dances&mdash;those are not in <i>my</i> line. I&#8217;ll
take you racing; I&#8217;ve a string of horses in training.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I love racing,&#8221; she admitted. &#8220;I&#8217;ve only seen
races once, and that was here.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Bah!&#8221; with a gesture of contempt, &#8220;a set of
platers! And so you are on the move at last?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Yes; we are going to live with Mrs. Hesketh.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;That old beldame! Well, you can choose between<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_359"></a>[359]</span>
Thornby and Sharsley. I won&#8217;t have any half measures&mdash;you
understand that?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Am I to be mistress of the house?&#8221; she asked
hardily. &#8220;I have an aunt, I believe?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;You have very much an aunt&mdash;she&#8217;d make <i>two</i>&mdash;but
she will move into her own flat. You look as if
you could hold your own, and sit at the head of a
table, and square on a horse.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I daresay I can soon learn English ways, and
I&#8217;m sure I could ride&mdash;but I don&#8217;t like leaving
mother.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I daresay not! You don&#8217;t know what is good for
you&mdash;and you can&#8217;t well bring her along, can you?
It must be one of us, or the other&mdash;Glyn or Blagdon!&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Yes, I know,&#8221; and Cara rose, and walked slowly
over to the window, and looked out. She was weighing
the vital question, &#8216;father or mother&#8217;? As she stood
irresolute, her eyes fell upon a splendid motor drawn
up below the hotel&mdash;<i>le dernier mot</i> of luxury, and extravagance.</p>

<p>&#8220;That&#8217;s my car,&#8221; announced her father, who had
followed, and was now looking over her shoulder.
&#8220;If you decide on <i>me</i>, we will go off this evening, and
I must give the chauffeur instructions about getting
to Dover. You and I will go straight to Paris, and
there you can rig yourself out before we go home&mdash;and
the sooner we make a start the better.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Do you really mean, that we are to leave here to-day?&#8221;
stammered Cara; who had been thinking of debating
the matter, and making up her mind, at leisure.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_360"></a>[360]</span>&#8220;Oh, yes&mdash;it&#8217;s now or never.&#8221;</p>

<p>Cara turned pale and then red.</p>

<p>&#8220;I want to get back for the Leger; you can settle
into Hill Street.&#8221; Noticing her change of colour, he
became more urgent. &#8220;Your grandmother&#8217;s lot will
take you up&mdash;the old Scropes are tremendous swells,
and your cousins the Calthorpes and Montfords will
trot you out and present you at Court, and all that
sort of thing&mdash;balls, and so on. Of course, you are a
bit young; but, as I tell you, you <i>look</i> old&mdash;old enough
to sport the Blagdon diamonds; and the family diamonds
are quite top-hole! There isn&#8217;t a finer show in
any opera-house.&#8221;</p>

<p>Presentations at Court, diamonds, French frocks,
balls, races, the command of a large establishment&mdash;Cara
felt that her head was swimming! What were
her mother and Oldcourt in comparison to such dazzling
temptations? Of course, she was behaving
badly; but in this world everyone must play for their
own hand. The Mum had made terrible mistakes, and
&#8216;revoked,&#8217; so to speak. Because she had spoiled her
life, why should she, Cara, do likewise? She felt
confident, that she could get on all right with this
burly, rough sort of father, and was not the least
afraid of him.</p>

<p>&#8220;Yes, by Jove, you and I will make a bolt; give
your mother the slip, and pay her out in her own coin,
ha! ha! She&#8217;s given to running away.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;If I come to live with you, you must never say a
word against the Mum.&#8221;</p>



<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_361"></a>[361]</span>&#8220;The word &#8216;<i>must</i>&#8217; is never to be used to me,&#8221; he
answered savagely.</p>

<p>&#8220;But why not?&#8221; demanded Cara, looking up at
him with twinkling eyes, and an enchanting smile.</p>

<p>What cheek she had! and what teeth! Absolutely
perfect. Slightly mollified, he resumed:</p>

<p>&#8220;If you are a good girl, I think we shall pull along
together all right, and I&#8217;ll say this for your mother, she
had a snaffle mouth,&mdash;though she <i>did</i> bolt. Of course,
you are inexperienced in English customs and housekeeping,
but you have the cut of a girl who will soon
know the ropes.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;If I go with you to-day, what am I to do for
clothes? All my things are up at Les Plans.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I can lend you a motor-coat to travel in, and you
will be in Paris in the early morning. We&#8217;ll start at
six, and dine on the train.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Very well,&#8221; she said gravely; &#8220;so be it.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;All right, that&#8217;s settled, Cara,&#8221; and he gripped her
hand with a gesture of possession. &#8220;Give me a kiss
on the bargain!&#8221;</p>

<p>She glanced round apprehensively&mdash;they were alone
in the lounge, then offered her square jaw, to his lips.</p>

<p>&#8220;By Jove, I&#8217;m glad to have you, my girl!&#8221; he said
with hearty satisfaction. &#8220;When a man is getting on
a bit, he feels the want of someone about him&mdash;someone
<i>belonging</i> to him&mdash;and that he&mdash;er&mdash;can be proud
of.&#8221;</p>

<p>As Cara and her father stood side by side, the five
o&#8217;clock boat moved slowly from her moorings, and came<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_362"></a>[362]</span>
out into the lake, exactly opposite to where they were
stationed.</p>

<p>&#8220;It&#8217;s the <i>Stadthof</i>. There goes mother!&#8221; said Cara
with a slight catch in her breath, &#8220;wondering what has
become of me; that is her I am sure&mdash;the figure at
the end. She expects to see me tearing along the Quai.
Don&#8217;t you see the lady with the blue sunshade&mdash;looking
back?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;No, my sight is not as young as yours,&#8221; he answered
gruffly. &#8220;She may look and look, but you have done
with her, you know, and have, what is called, burned
your boats! Now, come along with me, and I&#8217;ll buy
you a little souvenir of the occasion!&#8221;</p>

<p>The souvenir, took the form of a superb diamond ring,
which Cara placed with ecstasy upon her third finger.
The purchase had been speedy&mdash;since Blagdon, a
moneyed man, always knew exactly what he wanted&mdash;and
as they emerged to the water-side, Cara gazed
nervously down the lake. Yes, the steamer, bearing
her mother out of her life, was still in sight. Her eyes,
as she watched it rounding the promontory, were
blinded with tears; when she had brushed these away,
she looked once more, but the <i>Stadthof</i> and her
pretty Mum, had disappeared, as far as she was
concerned, for ever.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>Having accomplished her errands and visits, Letty
arrived punctually at the Bahnhof Pier, and looked
eagerly around for Cara and her parcels; but no Cara<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_363"></a>[363]</span>
appeared&mdash;she was not even in sight as the boat cast
off. Letty and her daughter were dining that evening
with Mrs. Hesketh, and at the Paradis she anxiously
awaited her. Cara had missed a boat on several
occasions, and come by the next; and now every
time the great revolving door swung, she expected to
see her enter. Time went on, dinner was over, the nine
o&#8217;clock steamer had passed by, brilliantly illuminated.</p>

<p>&#8220;What <i>can</i> have become of Cara?&#8221; said her mother.
&#8220;I know she was going to the Convent&mdash;it is not like
<i>them</i> to keep the child so late. Shall we go and wait in
the lounge?&#8221;</p>

<p>When the ladies entered, the hall, the concierge came
forward with a thin blue telegram, addressed to
&#8216;Mrs. Glyn,&#8217; and handed it to Letty, who tore it
open with shaking fingers. As her eyes glanced over
the contents, she gave a faint exclamation and
dropped the paper. Mrs. Hesketh picked it up instantly,
and read:</p>

<div class="blockquot">
<p>&#8220;Leaving for Paris with father. Good-bye. C.
Blagdon.&#8221;</p></div>
<hr class="chap x-ebookmaker-drop" />

<div class="chapter">
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_364"></a>[364]</span>

<h2 class="nobreak">CHAPTER XXXIV</h2>
</div>


<p class="drop-cap">THE shock of Cara&#8217;s desertion prostrated her
mother, and for many days she remained at
the Paradis, blanched and shaken, a stricken, ghost-like
guest. Her friend (now completely restored) had
taken the helm of her life in her hands, and was
making rapid preparations for their departure to
England.</p>

<p>&#8220;My poor dear child,&#8221; she said, &#8220;I am desperately
sorry for you. That your wound is deep, I know.
&#8216;How sharper than the serpent&#8217;s tooth it is to have a
thankless child,&#8217; so said old King Lear; all the same,
you will get over it.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;No, never, never!&#8221; replied Letty with energetic
emphasis; and her voice and face were unrecognisably
hard.</p>

<p>&#8220;Certainly you will. I speak from experience.
When my little boy died&mdash;&mdash;&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Your boy!&#8221; interrupted Letty, lifting her head;
&#8220;I never knew you had a child!&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I do not speak of him, but he was my treasure: a
darling. When he was three years old he fell out of a
window, and was killed before my very eyes. Then,
indeed, I would gladly have laid me down and <i>died</i>&mdash;but
here I am! trying to encourage you to rise again<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_365"></a>[365]</span>
and plod along the highway known as Life. If Harry
had lived, he would be your age; it is thirty-five years
since they closed the coffin-lid upon his little angel
face. To add to my agony, my husband declared that
the accident was <i>my</i> fault; the child was watching
me mounting my horse, he overbalanced, the nurse
grabbed at him, but only his sash, remained in her
hand.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;How dreadful!&#8221; cried her listener with streaming
tears.</p>

<p>&#8220;Yes, dear, you may weep a little for me; but as
for yourself, you must dry your tears, and enter upon
another life.&#8221;</p>

<p>It had been mooted on the mountain-side, in farm-houses
and cow-houses, that the rosy-cheeked English
girl, claimed by a rich father, had forsaken the pretty
mother who for thirteen years had toiled for her support.
Ah, a <i>wustus maden</i>!&mdash;(a bad girl).</p>

<p>A surprising amount of kindly sympathy was felt
and shown; many little farewell gifts were left at the
Paradis, addressed to &#8216;Frau Glyn,&#8217; and one afternoon
Letty nerved herself to ascend to Les Plans, for the
last time, in order to take leave of its inmates. There
they were, all ready to welcome her! the Josts, Freda,
the Frau herself, and a new dog&mdash;another Karo. In
the low-roofed sitting-room, when Letty and Frau
Hurter were alone, she said:</p>

<p>&#8220;All my little things here, my chair, and lace pillow,
work-basket, harmonium, and tea-service I hope you
will accept.&#8221;</p>



<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_366"></a>[366]</span>&#8220;But, <i>mein liebe Frau</i>, I never sew or play tunes. I
am old, and my fingers are like wood.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Fritz&#8217;s wife will be young?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Fritz&mdash;<i>ach ye!</i> He <i>knows</i>. My cousin writes he
is as mad, and off his head; he says he goes to America,
he cannot live here, ever&mdash;without <i>her</i>. The boy comes
to say good-bye in two days, and then we are forsaken&mdash;you
and I, by those for whom we would give the life&#8217;s
blood.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;He will get over it, dear Frau. Fritz is so young.
Ask him to come and talk to me, and I will do my
best, to persuade him to stay.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Yes, it may do good, since he loves you&mdash;we can
but try,&#8221; she paused to wipe her eyes on her apron;
&#8220;but as for you, dear lady, my heart aches. It seems
but yesterday, when you stood out there in the garden
in the sunshine a <i>girl</i>, with Mitli in your arms. What
you have been to her ever since, the good God, and I,
alone know. Now she has deserted you; try and put
her away from your thoughts.&mdash;You are still young,
you have your own life.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I am going to make another home; but what can
replace a <i>child</i>?&#8221; cried Letty, rising as she spoke.
&#8220;I want to see her room, and settle about her
things.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Her room is dusted and in order, otherwise as
she left it. We will go there now,&#8221; and Frau Hurter
climbed the stairs, and threw open the door into an
empty chamber.</p>

<p>There were Cara&#8217;s familiar frocks hanging on familiar<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_367"></a>[367]</span>
hooks; her silver-backed hair-brushes (a birthday
gift) on the dressing-table; a hat with the pins still
sticking in it, as it had been cast down, lay on the bed.
There was a little writing-table and blotter&mdash;both
spattered with ink&mdash;and peeping in at the window that
hoary old pear tree&mdash;the accomplice of the girl in her
midnight flights.</p>

<p>&#8220;<i>Ach ye!</i>&#8221; exclaimed Frau Hurter in a lachrymose
key, &#8220;there is the blouse you made her; the skirt you
embroidered, the little slippers.&mdash;Freda and I will
pack everything, and send them down by Jost.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;No, no; I could not bear to see them again,&#8221; protested
Letty, making an effort to choke back her tears.
&#8220;Please <i>keep</i> all, except the books and writing
materials, and personal treasures,&#8221; gathering them
together in feverish haste.</p>

<p>&#8220;Here are dozens and dozens of letters,&#8221; announced
Frau Hurter, who was diving into a deep drawer.</p>

<p>&#8220;What of them, <i>meine Frau</i>?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Let them go too.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;To England! Why not burn them?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;No, no, we will stuff them into this silk work-bag,
and tie them securely&mdash;let the child have all she <i>values</i>.
I will send a maid to-morrow to pack, and forward
everything to London.&#8221; After a pause, and a last
look round, she added, &#8220;I have been very, very happy
here, dear Frau, and I love your country&mdash;but I am
leaving it in a few days,&mdash;never to return.&#8221;</p>

<p>The two women clasped hands, and Frau Hurter,
the stony-faced, suddenly drew her fellow-sufferer into<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_368"></a>[368]</span>
her bony embrace, and kissed her with a sort of dry
and concentrated passion.</p>

<p>As Letty walked down the hill that lovely September
evening, she halted for a farewell look at the gleaming
lake and range of mountains&mdash;a scene beloved and
familiar as the face of a dear friend. How many hundred
times had she climbed this well-worn path&mdash;since the
day she had first carried Cara to the farm! Here on
this very spot, the little plateau under the pear trees,
had Cara thrown her arms about her, assuring her with
warm kisses that &#8220;she would never, never, <i>never</i> leave
her own darling Mum!&#8221;</p>

<p>As a pair of sad eyes, rested on the matchless
prospect, the sun was setting behind Pilatus,&mdash;who
stood forth grim and rugged, against a flaming
background of red and gold&mdash;a glorious afterglow
spread itself over the slopes of the Rigi, changing
its strata of granite to rose-colour, the intervening
pastures to a cloudy blue. Then very gradually,
as if by the touch of a magic wand, a delicate
ethereal haze dissolved the entire scene into an exquisite
shade of amethyst,&mdash;the curtain had fallen,
and a glorious September day, was numbered with
the past.</p>

<p>The air was still: the sleepy tinkling of a little stream,
a far-away hoot of some steamer approaching a landing-stage,
the faint sound of a chapel bell were the only
sounds that broke a curiously reverent, and impressive
silence.</p>

<p>Presently beautiful Hesperus, wrapped in her misty<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_369"></a>[369]</span>
mantle, came gliding along the mountain-tops, and
hung her bright star in the sky, and Letty continued
her way.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>Blagdon&#8217;s arrivals and departures were notoriously
abrupt, and after a busy and exciting three days in
Paris, he appeared in Hill Street with his unheralded
companion; looking forward with a sort of brutal glee
to &#8216;taking a splendid rise out of old Connie.&#8217; He had
merely announced his immediate return, &#8216;bringing a
friend.&#8217;</p>

<p>It was eight o&#8217;clock when he entered his smoking-room,
closely attended by Cara (who had been not a
little impressed by her father&#8217;s wealth, the appearance
of the home, and its group of silent, dignified men-servants&mdash;a
home where <i>she</i> was to reign as mistress).
Here, sunken in an arm-chair, with a dog on her lap, a
cigarette in her mouth, a sporting paper in her hand,
they discovered Lady Rashleigh. She was greatly
changed; her figure was shapeless, her hair a foxy grey,
her skin coarse, and deeply lined&mdash;altogether, especially
in a shabby deshabille, she deservedly earned the
adjective &#8216;Blowsy.&#8217; Yet at race meetings, in a well-cut
coat and handsome furs, Con Rashleigh was still
regarded as a wonderful woman for sixty&mdash;pity she
had let her figure go!</p>

<p>&#8220;Hullo, Blag!&#8221; she exclaimed, as she removed her
cigarette, &#8220;so here you are! Have you seen this
Handicap&mdash;why&mdash;who&#8217;s this?&#8221; surveying her niece<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_370"></a>[370]</span>
with an aggressive stare. Hugo occasionally introduced
startling acquaintances. &#8220;Who have we here?&#8221;
throwing down the Pom, and rising heavily to her feet.</p>

<p>The stranger was a tall, handsome girl with a vague
resemblance to someone&mdash;why, to Letty, to be sure!
In an illuminating flash she saw it all! Blag had
sprung one of his jokes on her, and brought home the
daughter!</p>

<p>&#8220;It&#8217;s only my little girl,&#8221; he announced with indescribable
pride; &#8220;five-foot-six in her stockings. She
has chucked Switzerland, and come to live with me.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Ah, so this is Cara,&#8221; drawing her towards her as
she spoke.</p>

<p><i>Ciel!</i> How her aunt smelt of whisky, and tobacco;&mdash;just
like a man, thought the girl as she passively
submitted to her kisses.</p>

<p>&#8220;Why did you not prepare me? Why keep this
pleasure to yourself?&#8221; continued Lady Rashleigh with
ostentatious composure.&mdash;In that brief moment she
had decided to be civil to the new-comer, and make no
<i>scene</i>. Hugo was undoubtedly struck, but his fancies
never lasted; he would tire of his novelty before the
month was out, and she resolved to sit tight in Hill
Street&mdash;the flat was let. This well-grown interloper
knew nothing of English society, and she determined
to keep her in the background, and rule her, as she had
done the pink-cheeked little fool, her mother.</p>

<p>But it was not long&mdash;in fact, less than five minutes&mdash;before
Connie Rashleigh discovered her mistake. Cara
was a true chip of the old block, as hard and ruthless<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_371"></a>[371]</span>
as herself, and with all the cocksureness and cruelty
of youth. The girl&#8217;s manner was self-possessed, she
talked glibly of Paris and their journey, and became
surprisingly animated as she volubly described her new
gowns. Meanwhile, her father looked on with swelling
pride. His eyes seemed to ask, Was there ever such a
complexion? such hair? such teeth? Connie Rashleigh
stared and listened with a feeling of dismal apprehension&mdash;which
apprehension proved to be but too
well founded, when at a hint from her father, Cara,
in a trailing tea-gown, sailed into the dining-room
before her aunt, and sank into a chair at the head of
the table.</p>

<p>&#8220;Cara is beginning as she is to go on,&#8221; explained
Hugo. &#8220;She is installed as the mistress of the house&mdash;the
robes, and the keys&mdash;eh, Cara?&#8221;</p>

<p>His methods were ever blunt: his idea of diplomacy
a bludgeon!</p>

<p>And Lady Rashleigh, choking with impotent fury,
was compelled to subside into a place at the side of
the board, with what appetite and grace she could
assume.</p>

<p>&#8220;Champagne, Carter&mdash;the &#8217;94,&#8221; commanded his
master; &#8220;we will drink Miss Blagdon&#8217;s health and
welcome.&#8221;</p>

<p>From this hour war&mdash;internecine, secret, and deadly&mdash;was
declared between aunt and niece; but the
victory was ever to the young. Cara ruled her father,
dominated the household, and openly despised her
predecessor.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_372"></a>[372]</span>Cara was a &#8216;female bounder,&#8217; in the opinion of that
lady, and brutally selfish. She &#8216;grabbed&#8217; everything:
the best room, the use of the motor, the carriage, the
pick of Mudie&#8217;s books, and the most comfortable
chairs. She poured out tea, did the honours with
amazing self-possession, and left her aunt to enjoy
the agreeable sensation of being the odd one out,&mdash;and
that, in the house in which she had been born!</p>

<p>Hugo had a few words to say to his sister with respect
to the new mistress.</p>

<p>&#8220;Look here, old girl, you must make it all right for
Cara. Take her round the Scrope lot, and write to
those in the country, and tell them she is with me. I
want her to get a flying start; and you know on which
side your bread is buttered,&#8221; he added with blunt
significance and doubtful taste. &#8220;After Christmas we
are going to Monte Carlo, and you must trot back to
your own flat; the girl says this house wants doing
up, and that the curtains and paper in the drawing-room,
make her sea-sick.&#8221;</p>

<p>The curtains and paper, Lady Rashleigh&#8217;s joy and
delight, had been her own selection!</p>

<p>Mr. Blagdon did not (as his sister had hopefully
anticipated) tire of his new discovery; on the contrary,
he was blatantly proud of his daughter, of her youth,
good looks, and animal spirits. She was not a success
among her grandmother&#8217;s set (and a little cowed by
that old lady), but for the sake of the family, they
accepted this loud, bouncing young person&mdash;they
shrank from further scandal. The girl carried herself<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_373"></a>[373]</span>
well, knew how to dress, spoke French fluently, and
danced admirably. She might have been <i>worse</i>! Who
could believe, that she had been brought up on a
Swiss farm? but then, these dear ladies had no experience
of the modern education which is afforded
in Swiss schools.</p>

<p>This quick-witted, adaptable damsel, soon picked up
society and racing jargon; she had the aplomb of a
woman of thirty, ruled her adoring father, banished
her unruly aunt, patronised&mdash;yes, patronised, the
Slaters, and overawed Lord Robby&mdash;in short, a
domestic Queen Elizabeth!</p>

<p>It was a cruel blow to poor Lady Rashleigh to be
compelled to abandon her luxurious home, the use of
a motor, gifts of money, and the loan of jewels, in order
to make way for a bold, aggressive young woman,
who was said to bear a resemblance to herself!
She retired in deplorably low spirits to what she was
pleased to call &#8216;her lair.&#8217; A six-roomed flat, with
two good sitting-rooms, two small bedrooms, and the
usual black hole for the accommodation of servants.
Cara paid her aunt a prompt visit&mdash;inspired by
curiosity, not affection. The suite, shabby and dusty,
commanded an extensive view of a garage; the drawing-room
was well furnished, but had the rakish air
of a <i>pass&eacute;e</i> beauty; and sofas and cabinets, (evident
spoil from Sharsley,) blocked up too much space. The
bedroom,&mdash;also encumbered by Sharsley furniture,
seemed to be half filled with piles of shabby cardboard
boxes of all sizes; here too were dozens of dusty<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_374"></a>[374]</span>
medicine bottles, ragged novels, old shoes, and on the
dressing-table, a coil of false hair, cigarette ashes, a
syphon, and the latest edition of <i>Ruff</i>. Two little
barking Poms ran in and out; and a gloomy cook,
with arms akimbo, stood in the kitchen doorway
staring with lowering eyes. Everything was untidy,
neglected, and squalid. No wonder Aunt Con preferred
to hang on in Hill Street!</p>

<p>And so the months passed, and Cara tasted intoxicating
delights of which she had merely dreamt. Among
her father&#8217;s associates, Miss Blagdon enjoyed <i>un grand
succ&egrave;s</i>. Here was no shrinking, awkward hostess, but
one whose dancing, skating, riding, and repartee found
many admirers,&mdash;whilst her influence over an adoring
parent was paraded with noisy ostentation. As for
her mother&mdash;she stored her comfortably away in the
remotest garret of her mind. They had met once; it
happened in a block in Piccadilly. Cara, queening it
in a huge open motor, with furs and rug of sable; her
mother and Mrs. Hesketh in a station omnibus, with
luggage on top. She had stared at her Mum, and the
Mum had bowed, but Cara was so taken aback by the
unexpected encounter, that she forgot to return the
salute; then there was a violent jerk, the policeman
had given a signal, and the omnibus passed on.</p>

<p>What a thing to have happened&mdash;she had actually
cut her own mother. How funny!</p>

<h2 class="nobreak">CHAPTER XXXV</h2>
</div>


<p class="drop-cap2">AS for Letty Glyn, she returned to Thornby bearing
her maiden name; a disgraced wife, who eighteen
years previously had left the village in such a
blaze of triumph, that its reflection had illuminated
three parishes. The knowledge of her altered circumstances
had long been public property, and mothers
whispered to their daughters as she passed, the story
of pretty Miss Letty, sometimes adding: &#8220;Aye, she
was a rare beauty, and carries her looks still!&#8221;</p>

<p>A paragraph in a society paper which penetrated to
the Indian frontier, informed Colonel Lumley that
&#8216;Hugo Blagdon and his daughter Miss Blagdon had
returned to Hill Street from the Riviera.&#8217;</p>

<p>So Cara, the blue-eyed, had deserted her mother, and
gone over to the enemy! And now Letty was free,
since &#8216;the cause and impediment&#8217; had abandoned
her. He determined to go home at once; but leave,
what about leave? Camps and man&#339;uvres were on
foot&mdash;he must bide his time until the autumn. Meanwhile,
he wrote and announced his plans and intentions
to Mrs. Glyn, Oldcourt, and she showed her friend part
of a letter which said:</p>

<p>&#8220;I shall take three months&#8217; &#8216;privilege leave&#8217; to
England, and I do not intend on this, the third,
occasion, to return <i>alone</i>.&#8221;</p>



<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_376"></a>[376]</span>It was early in September when Colonel Lumley
landed at Dover. As he glanced through the day&#8217;s
papers in the London train, his eye was arrested by
this paragraph: &#8220;Sudden death of Hugo Blagdon, the
well-known sportsman.&#8221;</p>

<p>It appeared that Mr. Blagdon had had a seizure on
a race-course, been conveyed to his hotel in an unconscious
condition, and there died. Here, indeed, was
news!</p>

<p>That same evening Colonel Lumley went down to
Thornby, where he was warmly welcomed by his
relatives. He dined at Oldcourt, and as he and Letty
sat once more at the table of a hostess who had once
rashly attempted to lend a hand to Fate&mdash;they
were a striking pair&mdash;though eighteen years had
elapsed since their last meeting in that very room.
In spite of the cruel shocks of fortune, Letty was still
a beautiful woman; the line of her features, the delicacy
of her skin, the shine on her glorious hair, had not
been tarnished. She looked radiant in mauve chiffon,
and wearing her mother&#8217;s Indian pearls. Her fianc&eacute;,
bronzed and in a way storm-beaten, was handsome;
the wearer of three well-deserved medals, and a leader
of men&mdash;but the simple girl of seventeen, and young,
eager, and impassioned Lancelot, were no more.</p>

<p>The following afternoon they walked together to the
crooked bridge, so well remembered by both; they
recalled that winter sunset, the spasmodic talk, the
expressive silence of many years ago; between then
and now, what a stretch of wide experience!</p>



<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_377"></a>[377]</span>&#8220;If I had only spoken out the last time I was
here,&#8221; said Lumley, &#8220;what a lot it would have saved
us! I daresay we would have been married in a
couple of years, and when our hearts were younger&mdash;though
for you, Letty, mine has never changed!&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Aunt Dorothy would never have allowed it,&#8221;
replied Letty with decision; &#8220;never. And you know
how she persuaded your aunt to tell me, that an engagement
between us, would be your <i>ruin</i>.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Good Lord, what a woman!&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I really married Hugo because I was terrified of
her.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Yes, unfortunate child, and went straight out of
the frying-pan, into the fire.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;But, Lancelot, I was the last sort of wife for
Hugo. I always seemed to do the wrong thing. I
believe, he would have been quite happy with a woman
of his own world. I was an experiment; a mistake,&#8221;
and her lip quivered.</p>

<p>&#8220;A costly mistake for you! Poor Letty,&#8221; and he
looked at her with peculiar tenderness. Now at last
she should have someone to protect her; someone to
stand between her, and the buffetings of Fate. &#8220;Where
is your aunt?&#8221; he enquired, &#8220;dead?&#8221; the tone was
positively hopeful.</p>

<p>&#8220;No, indeed, she is married again to a man ten years
younger than herself. They live at Brighton on her
money; and I&#8217;m told,&mdash;though this is dreadful gossip,&mdash;that
he gambles and flirts, and leads her rather a life;
but he is <i>very</i> good-looking, and she adores him.&#8221;</p>



<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_378"></a>[378]</span>&#8220;Impossible! She never adored anything in her
life but a blue plate! Letty, to turn to another much
more interesting subject&mdash;you will marry me soon,
won&#8217;t you&mdash;in a week?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Oh, no, Lancelot&mdash;he was only buried at Sharsley
on Friday. Let us wait a month, since&#8221;&mdash;and she
swallowed a lump in her throat&mdash;&#8220;we have waited so
long.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Well, all right, a month, so be it; a month
from to-day.&#8221;</p>

<p>Later, as they strolled towards the village, Lumley
said:</p>

<p>&#8220;When I passed through town yesterday, I lunched
at the Rag, and heard some fellows talking. They said
Blagdon had been frightfully hard hit over the Leger,
and indeed lately all round. When the numbers went
up he dropped his glasses, turned purple, and collapsed.
The doctors and the girl got him home. I&#8217;m afraid it
will be a tremendous change for <i>her</i>.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Yes, poor child, it must have been a dreadful shock;
but she will be rich&mdash;Cara is well provided for.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I am not so sure; you know the property is entailed.
Old Laban Blagdon never dreamt that the place
he was so proud of, would pass to a New Zealand
squatter.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;He will sell it, of course.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Impossible; it&#8217;s strictly tied up; miserable man,
it will be his white elephant. Frances says the house
is tumbling to pieces, and that rabbits swarm in the
grounds.&#8221;</p>



<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_379"></a>[379]</span>Later that same afternoon, the Blagdon affairs were
discussed in the Rectory drawing-room by Mrs.
Denton, her nephew, and Mrs. Hesketh,&mdash;whilst the
Rector took his friend Letty into the garden in order
to advise her respecting some important improvements.</p>

<p>&#8220;I had a long letter this morning from Doodie,&#8221;
announced her cousin. &#8220;You know she is always so
<i>deeply</i> interested in legacies, and wills. She tells me that
Hugo Blagdon&#8217;s debts to money-lenders are enormous;
and the Hill Street house is mortgaged to the roof, and
must be sold as it stands&mdash;and if there is three or four
hundred a year for Cara, she may think herself lucky.
She and her aunt are to live together in the flat.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I wonder how that arrangement will work out?&#8221;
said Colonel Lumley, &#8220;and how Cara and her aunt will
agree?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;They will fight like the Kilkenny cats,&#8221; rejoined
Mrs. Hesketh with prompt decision. &#8220;Let us hope
they will come to the same historical end.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;My dear friend,&#8221; protested Mrs. Denton, &#8220;I know
you don&#8217;t mean that! As for Cara, of course she is
headstrong, but she is young, and perhaps&mdash;&mdash;&#8221;</p>

<p>At this moment the door opened to admit a maid
carrying the tea-tray. As she was immediately followed
by Cara&#8217;s mother, and the Rector, Mrs. Denton&#8217;s
sentence remained for ever incomplete.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>There was a quiet wedding at Thornby when, for
the second time, &#8216;Lettice Kathleen&#8217; was married by
Mr. Denton. On this occasion, it was quite a humble<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_380"></a>[380]</span>
affair; there were no arches, no rice-throwing, no
champing grey horses, or gaping crowds; the newly
wedded couple, motored away from the church, and
spent the honeymoon in Devonshire.</p>

<p>Shortly before Colonel and Mrs. Lumley took their
departure for Lucknow, the latter received a long
letter from her daughter. It was urgent, incoherent,
and self-excusing (the immediate result of a terrific
encounter with her companion in the lair). She implored
her own sweet darling Mum, to take her with her
to India. Unlike the application to her father, this
effusion was not rewritten, altered, and recast: but
inscribed with many dashes, a flowing pen and assured
confidence. Cara told herself, that the Mum who had
never said no to her in all her life, or turned a deaf ear
to her most daring petitions, would be thankful to
have her back; her mental eye already beheld dazzling
visions of triumphs at the viceregal Court, the flower
of the Indian Army at her feet, her mother once more
her unselfish, and devoted slave.</p>

<p>But to Cara&#8217;s surprise her gushing despatch was
promptly answered by her stepfather; who in a firm,
clear hand, and a few terse sentences, conveyed to her,
her mother&#8217;s good wishes, forgiveness, and farewell.</p>

<p>A week later, Colonel and Mrs. Lumley sailed alone.</p>
